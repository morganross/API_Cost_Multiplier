SUMMARY
- Location (on disk): c:/dev/radiohead/process_markdown
- Git remote (origin): https://github.com/morganross/process_markdown.git
- Current branch: main
- Local HEAD commit: 6661b7a6e8aa4dbdd55d876bd85f013cb1bd4e8e
- Upstream: origin/main -> points to same commit (push completed)
- Note: A recent commit was created and pushed (see "Push activity" section).

DETAILED Git STATUS (porcelain)
The working-tree status captured most recently (porcelain, branch-aware) shows:

main...origin/main
M .gitignore
 D MA_CLI/Multi_Agent_CLI.py
 D MA_CLI/README_CLI.md
 D temp_process_markdown_noeval/ma_run_df8b1eb0-4751-428a-8b6a-8e588a0d6dc3/query_158ce848-b04c-4da4-be43-c41b8f0bce66.txt

Interpretation:
- The repository is on branch "main" and is aligned with origin/main (no ahead/behind differences at the time of the last push).
- There are unstaged working-tree changes:
  - Modified: .gitignore (local edits not staged/committed)
  - Deleted (files appear as D in working tree): the two MA_CLI files and an entry in temp_process_markdown_noeval. These deletions are present in the working tree but are not staged. If you stage and commit those deletions, the next push will remove those files from origin/main.
- NOTE: The "D" entries indicate tracked files that have been removed from the working tree but not yet staged as deletions.

NOTES / OBSERVATIONS FROM COMMANDS RUN
- While staging earlier, Git printed a line-ending normalization warning:
  "warning: in the working copy of 'MA_CLI/Multi_Agent_CLI.py', LF will be replaced by CRLF the next time Git touches it"
  and similarly for README_CLI.md.
  This is a local line-ending conversion warning and is informational. If cross-platform line endings are a concern, check .gitattributes and .gitconfig core.autocrlf settings.

- The file generate.py had local modifications that were changed and included in the pushed commit. The working-tree now shows additional unrelated changes (.gitignore edit, deletions). Those remain unstaged.

RECOMMENDED NEXT STEPS (explicit, safe)
1) Inspect the unstaged changes:
   - git -C process_markdown status --short
   - git -C process_markdown diff -- .gitignore
   - git -C process_markdown ls-files -d  (shows tracked files removed)

2) If you intend to include the unstaged changes in the remote:
   - Stage them: git -C process_markdown add --all
     Note: This will stage deletions (removing files from the repo on next commit) and modifications.
   - Commit: git -C process_markdown commit -m "Record local edits: update .gitignore; remove MA_CLI files and temp run query"
   - Push: git -C process_markdown push origin main

   Warning: Staging and committing deletions will permanently remove those paths from the branch history tip (they remain in history). Confirm before committing deletions.

3) If the deletions are accidental:
   - Restore the files from HEAD (working copy):
     git -C process_markdown checkout -- MA_CLI/Multi_Agent_CLI.py MA_CLI/README_CLI.md temp_process_markdown_noeval/ma_run_df8b1eb0-4751-428a-8b6a-8e588a0d6dc3/query_158ce848-b04c-4da4-be43-c41b8f0bce66.txt

4) If you only want to push the current staged changes (none staged now), do not run add --all; instead stage and commit only the desired files.

CLI commands I can run for you (examples):
- Show full status: git -C process_markdown status --porcelain=1 --branch
- Stage all changes: git -C process_markdown add --all
- Commit staged changes: git -C process_markdown commit -m "Your message"
- Push to origin/main: git -C process_markdown push origin main

WHAT I DID FOR YOU (so far)
- Collected repository metadata and status.
- Created this detailed status report file at: process_markdown/LOCAL_REPO_STATUS.md
- Previously staged/committed and pushed one set of changes (commit 6661b7a) — that push completed successfully.

NEXT ACTION (I need your confirmation)
You asked to "PUSH TO GITHUB" after making changes. The repository currently has new unstaged working-tree changes (shown above). Tell me how to proceed:
- Option A: "Stage, commit and push all current changes now" — I will run add --all, commit, and push. (This will record deletions.)
- Option B: "Only push staged changes (no staging)" — I will run git push; but there are no staged-but-uncommitted changes now.
- Option C: "Do not push; instead restore deleted files" — I will checkout the deleted files into the working copy.
- Option D: "Show me the diffs first" — I will display diffs for .gitignore and the deletions.

Please pick one option or type custom instructions.
