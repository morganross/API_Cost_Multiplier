REPEATED PROBLEMS — FPF CUTT OFF REPORT5
========================================

Purpose
-------
Synthesize the repository documentation (folder /docs/) into a meta-report about the author's state of mind, skills, workflow, and likelihood of successfully resolving the repeated "FPF cut off" problem. The synthesis emphasizes patterns and repeated troubleshooting notes about truncated/short/cut-off FilePromptForge outputs.

Scope & method
--------------
- I reviewed the repository docs and the recent investigation artifacts created during the debugging session (notably: REPEATING PROBLEM - cutt off fpf.txt, REPEATING PROBLEMS -cutt off reports 3rd time.txt, REPEATED PROBLEMS FPF CUTT OFF report4.txt, max_tokens_definitive_guide.md, gptr_api_token_limit_fix.md, gptr_model_fix.md, STREAMING-README.md and related grounding docs).
- I combined explicit findings (error logs and code diffs) with repeated themes in the docs to infer the author's approach, strengths, and likely failure modes.
- Focus: the repeated "cut off" symptom and what the docs reveal about how the author thinks and works.

Author profile — state of mind & abilities
------------------------------------------
1) Analytical and empirical
   - The author documents concrete terminal logs, exact error messages, and sample failed outputs.
   - They run repeated experiments (generate.py runs, targeted runs) and collect artifacts in temp directories for post-mortem analysis.
   - Evidence: multiple reports containing terminal traces and counts of requested vs produced reports.

2) Systematic and iterative
   - The docs show iterative fixes: mapping provider parameter names, centralizing a provider_adapter, adding fallbacks, and progressively adding instrumentation/logging.
   - The author creates step-by-step guidance and keeps a running checklist of actions and remaining tasks.

3) Pragmatic, oriented to compatibility
   - Repeated emphasis on mapping canonical settings (max_tokens) to provider-specific kwarg names (max_completion_tokens, maxOutputTokens, max_tokens_to_sample) shows practical awareness of cross-provider differences.
   - They prefer defensive fallbacks (retry with legacy names) to prevent total failures.

4) Safety-conscious and careful about edge-cases
   - Several docs stress token budgeting, streaming pitfalls, encoding/IO problems and saving raw payloads before post-processing.
   - There is explicit concern for provider rate/size limits and embedding chunking.

5) Detail-oriented but under time/complexity pressure
   - The docs are thorough but also reveal recurring short-term fixes and workarounds rather than an immediate comprehensive redesign (e.g., adapter fixes, then multiple further ad-hoc patches).
   - This suggests the author balances quick wins and longer-term refactors; occasional inconsistencies (helper removal, mixed client usage) indicate edits under pressure.

6) Strong troubleshooting skillset, moderate formal testing
   - The author writes clear investigation notes and does local reproduction. However formal unit/integration tests appear lacking; much of verification is manual runs and log inspection.

7) Collaboration & documentation habit
   - Good documentation practice: many markdown files describing specific problems, fixes, and rationale.
   - The docs read like the work journal of a single active maintainer who expects to iterate.

8) Awareness of larger architecture issues
   - Author understands that the real fix likely involves token counting, consistent adapter usage across the codebase, and replacing fragile ad-hoc code paths.

9) Caution around provider secrets & environment
   - The docs repeatedly mention API key sources and ADC issues — shows awareness of environment-driven failures.

10) Emotional tenor (implicit)
   - Tone is technical, mildly frustrated by recurring failures but focused — R&D/practical, not blaming; intent is to document and fix.

Primary recurring themes tied to "cutt off" symptom
---------------------------------------------------
- Provider parameter mismatches (wrong kwarg name) causing either rejection (400) or ignored limits producing short outputs.
- Poor token budgeting (no prompt+output token counting) leading to provider truncation or unexpected behavior.
- Adapter/adapter-callsite divergence: not all call sites use the central provider_adapter, so fixes are not uniform.
- Streaming/multipart JSON parsing failures: adapters returned only first chunk.
- Post-processing and I/O issues (encoding, partial writes, exceptions after receipt) that can leave files truncated.
- Authentication/credential gaps that cause fallback paths to use the wrong client or wrong kwargs.
- Lack of consistent tests to assert "no truncated outputs" across providers.

Assessment — chance of success
------------------------------
Given the author’s strengths and the current repository state, I estimate the chance of fully resolving the repeated cut-off problem at moderate-high (roughly 70% with focused work), assuming the author does the following:

Critical fixes required (high-impact)
- Restore and stabilize provider-grounding adapters (including authentication helper functions) so provider-side grounding runs reliably.
- Ensure provider-specific clients are used or that the client wrapper accepts provider-specific kwargs (avoid calling OpenAI client with "maxOutputTokens").
- Implement tokenizer-based prompt+output budgeting (tiktoken or provider-specific) and enforce safety margin before sending requests.
- Ensure adapters concatenate multi-part/streamed responses and save raw provider payloads for all runs.
- Replace ad-hoc fallbacks with controlled retry logic that rebuilds request kwargs cleanly for each attempt.
- Add unit/integration smoke tests: e.g., "long output test" for each provider asserting that output length > threshold and that raw provider payload matches saved output.

Process recommendations (medium-impact)
- Add a debug-mode flag to save raw JSON only when enabled and rotate/delete old debug artifacts automatically.
- Add structured logs for each API call: provider, model, final kwargs, response metadata (token usage), raw response path.
- Run a small CI job or local smoke test that runs the generation pipeline for minimal inputs for each provider.
- Consolidate all LLM call sites to consistently use provider_adapter.build_token_kwargs.

Non-technical suggestions (soft)
- Continue the thorough documentation practice — it provides excellent context for future contributors.
- Introduce short PR/patch review cycles for adapter and client-code changes; avoid large edits without small tests.

Likelihood timeline
-------------------
- Short term (hours → 1–2 days): fix google_adapter auth helper restoration, add _kwargs logging, and fix response concatenation. Expect improved diagnostics and some runs to succeed.
- Medium term (days → 1–2 weeks): implement prompt+output token counting, update remaining call sites to use provider_adapter, add smoke tests. Expect most truncation cases resolved.
- Long term (weeks): complete refactor for unified client abstraction (provider-specific client classes or a robust multi-provider wrapper), integrate CI tests. Expect near-zero recurrence of this class of failures.

Summary verdict
--------------
The author demonstrates the necessary skills, diligence, and discipline to fix the problem. The repeated "cut off" symptom stems from a combination of engineering complexity (multi-provider APIs, evolving SDKs), brittle per-call heuristics, and missing token-budget logic. The author is well-positioned to succeed with a focused set of technical changes (restore missing helpers, unify client mapping, add token counting, and strengthen tests). The current documentation and debugging artifacts are strong enablers — keep iterating with prioritized, testable changes, and the chance of success is high.

Web research findings appended (summarized)
------------------------------------------

I performed targeted web research (Google/StackOverflow/official SDK docs) to confirm behaviour and best practices relevant to the cut-off symptom. Below are consolidated findings and links discovered.

1) Google Gemini / Vertex AI generateContent — generationConfig.maxOutputTokens
   - Source: Vertex AI model inference docs (cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/model-reference/inference)
   - Finding: The Google Generative API uses generationConfig.maxOutputTokens (camelCase or snake_case depending on SDK) to limit output tokens. The JSON response uses a "candidates" array whose candidate objects contain content.parts[].text strings. Proper use of generationConfig.maxOutputTokens is required for longer outputs.
   - Link: https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/model-reference/inference

2) Gemini response schema & parsing advice
   - Source: Google GenAI SDK docs and developer pages (ai.google.dev and googleapis genai docs)
   - Finding: Responses commonly include candidates[].content.parts[].text. Long outputs may be split across multiple parts; client code must concatenate parts to reconstruct full output. Examples and jq filters confirm this structure.
   - Link: https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/text-generation

3) Google genai / google.genai SDK — typed config / max_output_tokens
   - Source: googleapis python-genai documentation and examples
   - Finding: SDK wrappers accept GenerateContentConfig with field max_output_tokens (snake_case) or maxOutputTokens in other language bindings; use SDK-native config types to set limits instead of injecting top-level names.
   - Link: https://googleapis.github.io/python-genai/

4) StackOverflow & examples: how to add maxOutputTokens
   - Source: StackOverflow thread showing REST payload using generationConfig.maxOutputTokens
   - Finding: For REST usage, include generationConfig:{maxOutputTokens: N} in the POST body. Using incorrect placement or key name causes the parameter to be ignored.
   - Link: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/79019151/how-to-add-maxoutputtokens-argument-to-gemini-api-request

5) OpenAI parameter naming changes — max_tokens vs max_completion_tokens vs client differences
   - Source: OpenAI community posts and GitHub issues
   - Finding: OpenAI has introduced new parameter names for some new models (e.g., o1 series) such that max_tokens is not supported in some endpoints; instead max_completion_tokens or different names are required. Many community issues show 400 unsupported_parameter errors when presenting the legacy key. This explains earlier 400s seen in repo logs.
   - Links: OpenAI community posts and GitHub issue threads (see referenced search results)

6) SDK shape mismatches cause TypeError on unexpected kwargs
   - Source: GitHub issues and Azure docs
   - Finding: If code constructs a kwargs dict with provider-specific keys but calls a client method that does not accept them (e.g., calling OpenAI client's chat.completions.create with Google-style maxOutputTokens), Python raises TypeError: unexpected keyword argument. This matches the repo error: Completions.create() got an unexpected keyword argument 'maxOutputTokens'.
   - Action: Ensure kwargs align with the actual client method signature (or call provider-appropriate client). 

Actionable takeaways from web research
-------------------------------------
- For Google Gemini calls use generationConfig.maxOutputTokens (via SDK types where possible). When parsing results, iterate candidates[].content.parts and concatenate parts to reconstruct the full output.
- Do not pass provider-specific param names to a different provider's client; instead:
  - Use provider-specific client (google.genai for Gemini) when calling Google endpoints.
  - Or translate canonical param -> concrete client's expected param before calling.
- Add logging of final kwargs and persist raw JSON responses (done) for debugging; also capture and log response usage metadata (promptTokenCount, candidatesTokenCount).
- Ensure environment credentials (ADC or GOOGLE_API_KEY) are available and that auth header/query param is correct.

Task progress (updated)
- [x] Read repository docs and investigation artifacts
- [x] Created REPEATED PROBLEMS FPF CUTT OFF REPORT5.TXT
- [x] Performed web research confirming generationConfig.maxOutputTokens and response schema (candidates -> content -> parts)
- [x] Summarized web findings and appended them to REPORT5
- [ ] Implement remaining fixes (restore helpers, client selection, token-budgeting)
- [ ] Re-run targeted tests and verify results

Next recommended step
---------------------
Restore any missing helper functions in google_adapter (e.g., _choose_auth_headers), ensure provider-specific client usage (google.genai for Gemini calls) or translate token kwarg names to the client you actually call, then re-run a targeted grounding test and preserve the raw JSON response for analysis.
