Generate.py run ‚Äî Detailed error report
Timestamp: 2025-09-06 16:47 (local)

Summary
-------
I ran python -u api_cost_multiplier/generate.py and captured the full terminal output. Below is a line-by-line analysis of every error/warning/exception I identified in that output, the probable cause, and recommended fixes (including exact code snippets where applicable). I saved this report here so you can review and apply fixes: api_cost_multiplier/docs/generate_errors_report.md

1) Warning: Could not create config directory
------------------------------------------------
Terminal lines:
[MA run 1] Warning: Could not create config directory at 'C:\Program Files s\Python313\config'
[MA run 1] Error: Could not write default task.json to 'C:\Program Files\P Python313\config\task.json'

Explanation:
The process attempted to create and write files under "C:\Program Files\..." (the Python installation directory). This is a protected location on Windows and typically requires elevated (admin) permissions. The path also appears malformed in the first warning (extra space / truncated text), suggesting either a path construction bug or console output corruption.

Impact:
Scripts which expect to create configuration files in a writable per-user directory failed and may operate with defaults or missing configuration.

Recommended fixes:
- Prefer a per-user config path (e.g., use %APPDATA% or os.path.expanduser("~/.config/...")) rather than Program Files.
- If the code intentionally writes there, run with appropriate permissions or change the config directory path via environment var or CLI.

Example change (conceptual ‚Äî locate where config_dir is computed and replace):
old (pseudo):
    config_dir = sys.prefix + os.path.sep + "config"
new:
    config_dir = os.getenv("MYAPP_CONFIG_DIR") or os.path.join(os.path.expanduser("~"), ".myapp", "config")

Alternative:
- Run the tool in a user context or set an environment variable that points to a writable config directory.

2) Garbled / corrupted console output
--------------------------------------
Terminal excerpt (garbled):
[MA run 1] ‚ö†Ô∏è Err[MA run 1 ERR] or INiFnO :r e a d i n[g1 6J:S4O7N: 0a0n]d d  üîç fSatialretdi ntgo  trheep ariers ewairtchh j stoans_kr efpoarir :' R' ...

Explanation:
Large portions of the console output appear corrupted or interleaved with stray characters. This could be:
- A console encoding mismatch.
- Multiple asynchronous tasks writing to the terminal simultaneously producing interleaved bytes.
- Log-lines being emitted concurrently from different threads/processes without locking.

Impact:
Makes logs harder to read and can mask real errors.

Recommended fixes:
- Ensure all logging uses the same encoding (UTF-8) and the console supports it.
- Use thread-safe logging handlers or centralize log emission (QueueHandler ‚Üí QueueListener) for asynchronous components.
- If the garbling persists, capture logs to files (per-task files) instead of writing to the shared stdout simultaneously.

3) INFO entries (non-errors) ‚Äî provider web browsing / planning
---------------------------------------------------------------
These are info messages; not errors. They show the MA run starting research and attempting web browsing/planning.

4) AttributeError: 'str' object has no attribute 'append'
---------------------------------------------------------
Terminal excerpt (trimmed to key lines):
File ".../gpt_researcher/gpt_researcher/skills/researcher.py", line 312, in _get_context_by_web_search
    sub_queries.append(query)
AttributeError: 'str' object has no attribute 'append'

Explanation:
The function _get_context_by_web_search calls:
    sub_queries = await self.plan_research(query, query_domains)
then later:
    if self.researcher.report_type != "subtopic_report":
        sub_queries.append(query)

The error occurs because plan_research returned a string (or otherwise non-list) and the code assumes sub_queries is a list. Attempting to call .append on a str raises this AttributeError.

Why it happens:
- plan_research (wrapper around plan_research_outline) can return a single string or other non-list when no sub-queries are generated.
- The code does not validate/normalize the return value to a list.

Lines to look at (from file):
- sub_queries = await self.plan_research(query, query_domains)
- self.logger.info(f"Generated sub-queries: {sub_queries}")
- if self.researcher.report_type != "subtopic_report":
    sub_queries.append(query)

Recommended code fix
--------------------
Normalize sub_queries to always be a list right after calling plan_research. Replace the single block with the snippet below (exact placement: in _get_context_by_web_search immediately after sub_queries = await self.plan_research(...)):

Replace (approximate original):
    sub_queries = await self.plan_research(query, query_domains)
    self.logger.info(f"Generated sub-queries: {sub_queries}")

With:
    sub_queries = await self.plan_research(query, query_domains)
    # Normalize sub_queries to a list. plan_research may return a string or None.
    if sub_queries is None:
        sub_queries = []
    elif isinstance(sub_queries, str):
        sub_queries = [sub_queries]
    elif not isinstance(sub_queries, (list, tuple)):
        # coerce other iterable types to list
        try:
            sub_queries = list(sub_queries)
        except Exception:
            # fallback: treat as single item
            sub_queries = [str(sub_queries)]
    self.logger.info(f"Generated sub-queries: {sub_queries}")

Additional related fix (recommended)
- At other call sites (e.g., where results from _get_context_by_web_search are consumed), ensure the code handles both string and list return types. For example, earlier in conduct_research:

Original snippet:
    additional_research = await self._get_context_by_web_search(self.researcher.query, [], self.researcher.query_domains)
    research_data += ' '.join(additional_research)

If additional_research can be a string, ' '.join(additional_research) will join characters. Safer pattern:
    if isinstance(additional_research, str):
        research_data += additional_research
    else:
        research_data += ' '.join(additional_research)

Locate and update these concatenations accordingly.

Rationale:
Defensive normalization prevents AttributeErrors when dependent functions return different types, and makes function behavior consistent.

5) Traceback chain (context)
-----------------------------
The AttributeError bubbled up through many layers of async execution (langgraph/pregel runner code), which only obscures the root cause. The core fix is in researcher._get_context_by_web_search normalization.

6) FilePromptForge / OpenAI API BadRequestError: Unsupported parameter 'max_tokens'
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Terminal excerpt:
openai.BadRequestError: Error code: 400 - {'error': {'message': "Unsupported parameter: 'max_tokens' is not supported with this model. Use 'max_completion_tokens' instead.", 'type': 'invalid_request_error', 'param': 'max_tokens', 'code': 'unsupported_parameter'}}

Location in code:
api_cost_multiplier/FilePromptForge/gpt_processor_main.py
client.chat.completions.create(
    model=model,
    messages=messages,
    temperature=temperature,
    max_tokens=max_tokens
)

Explanation:
The OpenAI Python client and/or the OpenAI backend for that provider/model no longer accepts the parameter name max_tokens for this chat completions endpoint and expects max_completion_tokens instead. The code currently passes max_tokens regardless of provider/model.

Recommended code fix
--------------------
Use provider- and client-aware parameter mapping. Apply conditional parameter naming for OpenAI models that require max_completion_tokens.

Replace the call:

    response = client.chat.completions.create(
        model=model,
        messages=messages,
        temperature=temperature,
        max_tokens=max_tokens
    )

With provider-aware mapping, for example:

    if provider.lower() == "openai":
        # Newer OpenAI chat completions use max_completion_tokens
        response = client.chat.completions.create(
            model=model,
            messages=messages,
            temperature=temperature,
            max_completion_tokens=max_tokens
        )
    else:
        # Other providers / older clients
        response = client.chat.completions.create(
            model=model,
            messages=messages,
            temperature=temperature,
            max_tokens=max_tokens
        )

Notes:
- Confirm the exact client method signature for your openai package version. If using the official OpenAI Python library that follows new API contracts, max_completion_tokens is required.
- For OpenRouter or other providers, check their client docs and pass the correct parameter.
- Add a defensive try/except to capture Unsupported parameter errors and map them automatically if possible.

Example expanded handling (robust pattern):
    try:
        response = client.chat.completions.create(
            model=model,
            messages=messages,
            temperature=temperature,
            max_completion_tokens=max_tokens  # preferred for modern OpenAI models
        )
    except Exception as e:
        # Fallback to older param name if necessary
        try:
            response = client.chat.completions.create(
                model=model,
                messages=messages,
                temperature=temperature,
                max_tokens=max_tokens
            )
        except Exception:
            raise

7) Failure to produce .md output (cascade)
-------------------------------------------
Terminal lines:
FPF run 1 failed: No .md output found in .../out
FilePromptForge generated: 0
No generated files to save for .../Census Bureau.md

Explanation:
Due to the API error (BadRequest), the FilePromptForge run failed to produce the expected md output, so nothing was saved. This is a downstream effect of the incorrect parameter name being sent to the provider.

Fix:
Resolve the API parameter issue above; re-run.

8) Grounding fallback warnings
-------------------------------
Terminal excerpt:
grounding.grounder: Provider-side grounding not available for provider=openai, model=gpt-5-mini. allow_external_fallback=False
WARNING - Provider-side grounding unavailable and external fallback not permitted. Proceeding without grounding.

Explanation:
The grounder attempted to use provider-side grounding; the provider/model combination did not support it. The code correctly warns and proceeds (or fails depending on configuration). This is a configuration/feature mismatch: either pick a provider/model that supports provider-side grounding, or set allow_external_fallback True (if safe).

9) Other observations and actionable checklist
-----------------------------------------------
- The generate.py run produced one MA run that failed (exit code 1) due to the AttributeError, and one or more FPF runs where one provider call failed due to max_tokens param and the other provider run (gemini-2.5-flash) succeeded.
- Problems to fix (priority order):
  1. Fix researcher._get_context_by_web_search to normalize sub_queries (prevents AttributeError).
  2. Fix FilePromptForge to pass correct parameter name to OpenAI (max_completion_tokens), and add provider-aware mapping/fallback.
  3. Fix config path handling (do not attempt to write to Program Files).
  4. Improve logging (avoid garbled outputs) and capture logs to per-process files to prevent concurrency corruption.

Suggested PR / patch snippets
-----------------------------
A) researcher.py ‚Äî normalization (insert after call to plan_research)
```
sub_queries = await self.plan_research(query, query_domains)
# Normalize sub_queries to always be a list
if sub_queries is None:
    sub_queries = []
elif isinstance(sub_queries, str):
    sub_queries = [sub_queries]
elif not isinstance(sub_queries, (list, tuple)):
    try:
        sub_queries = list(sub_queries)
    except Exception:
        sub_queries = [str(sub_queries)]
self.logger.info(f"Generated sub-queries: {sub_queries}")
```

B) gpt_processor_main.py ‚Äî OpenAI parameter mapping (replace the create call):
```
try:
    if provider.lower() == "openai":
        response = client.chat.completions.create(
            model=model,
            messages=messages,
            temperature=temperature,
            max_completion_tokens=max_tokens
        )
    else:
        response = client.chat.completions.create(
            model=model,
            messages=messages,
            temperature=temperature,
            max_tokens=max_tokens
        )
except TypeError as e:
    # Fallback: try swapping param name if server rejects unexpected parameter
    # (This will also log the original exception)
    if self.logger:
        self.logger.debug("Retrying with alternate token parameter name due to TypeError/BadRequest", exc_info=True)
    response = client.chat.completions.create(
        model=model,
        messages=messages,
        temperature=temperature,
        max_tokens=max_tokens
    )
```

C) Logging improvements
- Use a QueueHandler/QueueListener pattern for multi-thread/process logging to avoid interleaved output.
- Ensure handlers use encoding='utf-8'.

D) Config directory
- Ensure config directory is resolved to a writable location by default (user's home dir). If the code intentionally needs to write into sys.prefix, keep that as opt-in only and document the need for elevated permissions.

Files I inspected
------------------
- api_cost_multiplier/gpt-researcher/gpt_researcher/skills/researcher.py (root cause of AttributeError)
- api_cost_multiplier/FilePromptForge/gpt_processor_main.py (root cause of BadRequestError)
- Full generate.py run output (terminal capture)

Next steps (if you want me to implement)
----------------------------------------
- I can open a PR that:
  - Applies the sub_queries normalization in researcher.py (one-line insertion + minor tests).
  - Adds provider-aware param mapping and fallback logic in gpt_processor_main.py.
  - Adds a small fix to not attempt to write to Program Files for config files.
- I can run the generate script again after making the code changes to verify the fixes and produce an updated run report.
