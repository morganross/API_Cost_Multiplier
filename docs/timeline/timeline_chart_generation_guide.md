Run and OBSERVE OUTPUT FROM GENERATE.PY

read the live termainl console output. read the logs. then make a chart that discribes the run of generate.py. use the following instructions to make the chart.




Timeline Chart Generation Guide (Concise)

1. Create the file

- Create a new Markdown file in /docs/timeline/.
- Include a human readable time in the filename. do not include seconds.

2. Table structure (5 columns)

- Column 1: Run (from config)
- Column 2: Timeline (verbatim)
- Column 3: Output file(s) with size
- Column 4: Any file < 5 KB?
- Column 5: Errors/Notes

3. Data sources

- Config: api_cost_multiplier/config.yaml (runs list)
- Logs: /logs/acm_session.log (use the “timeline” section at the bottom)
- Output directory: path defined by output_folder in config.yaml

4. How to populate each row (one row per configured run)

- Column 1 (Run from config):

  - Build a key from config.yaml:

    - fpf: {provider}:{model}
    - gptr: {provider}:{model}
    - dr: {provider}:{model}
    - ma: {model} (MA has no provider in config)

  - Example: gptr:openai:gpt-4.1-mini, fpf:google:gemini-2.5-flash, ma:gpt-4o

- Column 2 (Timeline verbatim):

  - Open /logs/acm_session.log and find the “timeline” section at the bottom.
  - Copy the line(s) corresponding to this run exactly as written.
  - If multiple matching timeline lines exist, include all (separate with ).
  - If there is no timeline line for this run, leave blank and note in Column 5.

- Column 3 (Output files + size):

  - Determine output paths from logs and/or known naming patterns, then verify by listing files in the output_folder from config.yaml.

  - List every associated file with its size, e.g.:

    - 100_EO_14er_Block.gptr.1.gpt-4.1.md (4.7 KB)
    - report.json (2.1 KB)

  - If no files were produced, write “None”.

- Column 4 (Any file < 5 KB?):
  - “Yes” if any associated output file is smaller than 5 KB; otherwise “No”.

- Column 5 (Errors/Notes):

  - Record any errors found in logs for this run.

  - Note anomalies:

    - Missing from timeline
    - No output files
    - Multiple timeline lines for one run
    - Multiple output files, unusually small files (< 5 KB), or anything suspicious.

5. Sorting

- Sort all rows by Column 1 (ascending).

6. Formatting tips

- Use a Markdown table.
- For multiple entries in a single cell, separate with .
- Keep Column 2 strictly verbatim from the log (“timeline” section).

Example header | Run (config) | Timeline (verbatim) | Output file(s) with size | Any file < 5 KB? | Errors/Notes | |---|---|---|---|---|



YOU MAY NOT CREATE SCRIPTS TO GET THE INFO. YOU MAY RUN ONE SCRIPT AND ONE COMMAND TOTAL. ONE SCRIPT TO GET THE TINELINE INFO, AND ONE COMMAND TO GET THE FILES FROM THE DIR AND THEIR SIZES.

YOU MUST READ INDIVUAL FILES, YOU MUST READ THE LOG FILES. YOU MUST SEARCH THE DIR FOR FILES. YOU MUST FILL OUT THE CHART BY HAND. MANUALLY. 


THE FOLLOWING ARE THE OLD INSTRUCTIONS. THE ABOVE IS THE CURRENT INSTRUCTIONS.









This guide explains how to understand and generate timeline charts for the `api_cost_multiplier` pipeline. These charts are crucial for visualizing the execution flow, identifying performance issues, and verifying the output of different runs (Multi-Agent, GPT-Researcher, FPF).

## 1. Understanding the Timeline Chart Structure

A timeline chart provides a structured overview of a pipeline run, organized into three main columns:

*   **Column 1: Configured Run Details:** Each row in this column represents a specific run configuration as defined in your `config.yaml` file. This includes the run type (e.g., `fpf`, `gptr`, `ma`), provider, and model.

*   **Column 2: Timeline Log Entries:** This column contains relevant entries from the `TIMELINE` section of the `acm_session.log` file. These entries are directly related to the corresponding configured run in Column 1. There can be zero to multiple timeline entries per cell, detailing significant events, start/end times, and status updates for that specific run.

*   **Column 3: Generated Files and Sizes:** This column lists all files generated by the `api_cost_multiplier` during the execution of the corresponding run. The files and their paths are identified by reading the `acm_session.log` file and cross-referencing with the output directory. For each listed file, its size will also be included. There can be zero to multiple file entries per cell.

## 2. Manual Generation of a Timeline Chart (Without Scripts)

This method involves inspecting log files and directories directly using basic terminal commands.

1.  **Identify Configured Runs:**
    Open `api_cost_multiplier/config.yaml`. The `runs:` section lists all configured runs. Each item under `runs` (e.g., `- type: fpf`, `- type: gptr`) represents a single run configuration.

2.  **Locate the `acm_session.log` File:**
    The main log file is located at `api_cost_multiplier/logs/acm_session.log`. This file contains a comprehensive record of all activities, including the `TIMELINE` section at the end of each pipeline execution.

3.  **Extract Timeline Information:**
    After a pipeline run, open `api_cost_multiplier/logs/acm_session.log`. Scroll to the end or search for `[TIMELINE]`. The entries following this marker provide a summary of each run. Each line in the `TIMELINE` section typically corresponds to a run and its outcome.

4.  **Identify Generated Files and Their Sizes:**
    *   **From `acm_session.log`:** Look for `[FILES_WRITTEN]` entries in the `acm_session.log`. These entries will indicate which files were saved and their paths.
    *   **From Output Directory:** Navigate to your configured `output_folder` (specified in `config.yaml`). You can use `ls -l` (Linux/macOS) or `dir` (Windows) to list files and their sizes. Match these files to the runs based on their names and timestamps.

5.  **Manually Construct the Chart:**
    Combine the information gathered in steps 1-4 into a table format (e.g., a Markdown table) with the three columns described in Section 1.



## 4. Automatic Generation at the End of a Report

The `runner.py` script is designed to automatically append a timeline summary to the `acm_session.log` file after each complete pipeline execution. This summary is generated by an internal call to the `timeline_from_logs.py` script, ensuring that the `acm_session.log` always contains the latest timeline information for the entire run.

To view this automatically generated timeline:

1.  After a pipeline run, open `api_cost_multiplier/logs/acm_session.log`.
2.  Scroll to the very end of the file. You will find a section marked `[TIMELINE]` followed by the detailed chart.
