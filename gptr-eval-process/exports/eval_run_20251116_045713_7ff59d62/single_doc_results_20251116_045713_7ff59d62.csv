17,100_ EO 14er & Block.gptr.1.gemini-2.5-flash.qm2.md,google:gemini-2.5-flash-lite,1,factuality,2,"The document contains several factual inaccuracies. It claims President Donald J. Trump signed EO 14246 on March 25, 2025, and it was published on March 28, 2025. While the signing date is correct, the publication date in the Federal Register was also March 28, 2025. The document also states that Judge John D. Bates issued a temporary restraining order and later declared the EO 'null and void' on a motion for summary judgment. However, legal sources indicate that Judge Bates issued a temporary restraining order and later permanently blocked the executive order, finding it unconstitutional. The claim about the EO being declared 'null and void' on summary judgment is not explicitly supported by the search results, which focus on the permanent injunction and ruling of unconstitutionality. Additionally, the document mentions Jenner & Block suing the administration on March 28, 2025, which aligns with the temporary restraining order being issued around that date, but the permanent injunction ruling occurred later in May 2025. The document also states the EEOC was directed to investigate Jenner & Block's employment practices under Title VII, but this specific directive is not clearly supported by the provided search results, which focus on the security clearance, contract termination, and hiring prohibitions. The claim that Jenner & Block represented clients in 'gender and immigration issues' is also presented as a reason for the EO in the document, but the EO itself (as per search results) focuses more broadly on 'partisan litigation,' 'lawfare,' and specific alleged conduct rather than explicitly naming these categories as the sole or primary justification for punitive measures, although it does mention 'attacks against women and children based on a refusal to accept the biological reality of sex' and 'obstruction of efforts to prevent illegal aliens from committing horrific crimes and trafficking deadly drugs'.",2025-11-16T04:59:54.135673Z
