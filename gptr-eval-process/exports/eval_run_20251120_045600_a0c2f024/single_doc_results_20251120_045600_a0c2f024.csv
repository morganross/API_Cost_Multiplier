Multiple sources confirm that the order was indeed issued by Trump on March 25, 2025, however, a federal judge permanently enjoined the order on May 23, 2025, ruling it unconstitutional. The document also incorrectly claims the government intends to appeal this ruling, when in fact the government *has* appealed the ruling. The document states the order was designed to address alleged racial discrimination through DEI programs, which is not directly supported by the search results; the results mention criticism of DEI policies as a justification for the order, but not an investigation into racial discrimination through DEI programs specifically. The document also makes claims about the order's justification regarding 'attacks against women and children' and 'illegal aliens,' which are not directly verifiable in the provided search snippets but are generally aligned with the stated justifications for similar executive orders targeting law firms.",2025-11-20T04:58:53.705820Z
