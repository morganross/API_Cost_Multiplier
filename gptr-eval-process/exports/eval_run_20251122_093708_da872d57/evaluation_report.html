<span class="score-badge score-high" title="google:gemini-pro-latest: The report is comprehensive. It details the hypothetical order, analyzes its stated and perceived intent, places it in a broader strategic context, assesses its potential harms, and proposes specific remedies. It leaves no major questions about the scenario unanswered.">5</span>
<span class="score-badge score-high" title="openai:gpt-5.1: It addresses all specified dimensions—official framing, concrete directives, public justification, deeper intent, strategic context, harms, and remedies—but gives limited treatment to the post-issuance litigation history and judicial rulings that permanently enjoined the order.">4</span>
</td>
<td>
<span class="score-badge score-high" title="google:gemini-pro-latest: The analysis is exceptionally deep. It moves beyond a surface-level description of the hypothetical order to connect it to broader, real-world concepts like the unitary executive theory, Project 2025, and Schedule F, demonstrating a systemic critique of authoritarian strategies.">5</span>
<span class="score-badge score-high" title="openai:gpt-5.1: The analysis goes beyond description to connect EO 14246 to antitrust rhetoric, prior Republican ESG/DEI threats, Schedule F reclassification, Project 2025, and separation-of-powers concerns, showing systemic understanding and nuanced critique.">5</span>
</td>
<td>
<span class="score-badge score-high" title="google:gemini-pro-latest: While the executive order is fictional, the document accurately grounds its narrative in real-world political and legal contexts. The descriptions of Project 2025's goals, the purpose of Schedule F, and the documented threats by Republican officials against corporations and law firms for their ESG/DEI initiatives are all factually correct and verified.">5</span>
<span class="score-badge score-mid" title="openai:gpt-5.1: Key events and documents (EO 14246, EO 14171, EO 14147, the March 22 memo, and law-firm targeting) are accurately grounded in official and reputable sources, but some descriptions overstate or misstate what EO 14246 actually orders (e.g., claiming the Attorney General must file disqualification motions and invoking 'subversive activities' and 'climate cartels' language not present in the order), so it is not error-free.">3</span>
</td>
<td>
<span class="score-badge score-high" title="google:gemini-pro-latest: The document perfectly adheres to the specified political perspective. It uses strong, critical language ('Legal Counsel Purge,' 'weaponization,' 'rising fascism') and directly attributes the actions to an authoritarian agenda, fully aligning with the 'fiercely anti-fascist' criterion.">5</span>
<span class="score-badge score-high" title="openai:gpt-5.1: It consistently advances a left-leaning, anti-authoritarian critique, explicitly describes the order as fascistic/authoritarian, and centers threats to civil rights, DEI, and democratic guardrails without adopting a both-sides frame.">5</span>
</td>
<td>
<span class="score-badge score-high" title="google:gemini-pro-latest: The document is concise and avoids repetition. Each section introduces new information or analysis, building upon the previous points without unnecessarily restating them. The arguments are presented with precision.">5</span>
<span class="score-badge score-high" title="openai:gpt-5.1: Arguments are developed once and then built upon; there is minimal repetition or filler, and each section introduces distinct angles or details.">5</span>
</td>
<td>
<span class="score-badge score-high" title="google:gemini-pro-latest: The document perfectly aligns with the implied task of creating an internal policy analysis for a left-leaning organization. It adopts the specified tone, format, and political perspective to analyze a hypothetical threat, making it highly relevant to its intended purpose.">5</span>
<span class="score-badge score-high" title="openai:gpt-5.1: The report focuses squarely on Executive Order 14246, follows the requested policy-analysis framing, and aligns with the specified anti-authoritarian, partisan-intent evaluation brief without drifting off-topic.">5</span>
</td>
<td>
<span class="score-badge score-high" title="google:gemini-pro-latest: The language is highly charged and intense, using terms like 'purge,' 'intimidation,' 'weaponization,' 'bill of attainder,' and 'rising fascism.' This aligns perfectly with the 'bombastic' and 'inflammatory' end of the scale.">5</span>
<span class="score-badge score-high" title="openai:gpt-5.1: The language is strongly charged—using terms like 'bill of attainder in spirit,' 'rising fascism,' and 'authoritarian overreach'—yet remains structured and evidence-based rather than purely sensationalist.">4</span>
</td>
<td>
<span class="score-badge score-high" title="google:gemini-pro-latest: The report uses high-quality sources, including legal news outlets, law firm analyses, and academic blogs, to ground its futuristic scenario in documented, real-world trends and threats. The sourcing is appropriate and enhances the plausibility of the analysis.">5</span>
<span class="score-badge score-mid" title="openai:gpt-5.1: Citations draw on credible law firm alerts, civil rights organizations, academic blogs, and some mainstream legal commentary, but the report leans heavily on secondary analysis and only indirectly on primary government documents such as Federal Register entries or the EO text itself.">3</span>
</td>
<td>
<span class="score-badge score-high" title="google:gemini-pro-latest: The document closely follows the spirit and order of the 7-part structure, but uses slightly different headers (e.g., 'Our Designation' instead of 'Derisive Name'). It also splits the 'Stated vs Nefarious Purpose' concept into two separate sections, which is a minor deviation from the specified format.">4</span>
<span class="score-badge score-high" title="openai:gpt-5.1: The content clearly maps onto the required seven conceptual sections (title, derisive name, actions, stated vs. nefarious purpose, broader plan, harms, remedies) and keeps them in order, but it splits the purpose into two separate sections and adds extra elements like a table of contents and references, so it is not a perfectly strict seven-part format.">4</span>
</td>
<td>
<span class="score-badge score-high" title="google:gemini-pro-latest: The document is written in a clear, professional, and persuasive style suitable for an internal policy report. The arguments are well-articulated and flow logically, making the complex legal and political analysis easy to understand.">5</span>
<span class="score-badge score-high" title="openai:gpt-5.1: The document is tightly written, well-structured with clear headings and bullets, and maintains a coherent, professional narrative despite its strong advocacy stance.">5</span>
</td>
<td>
<span class="score-badge score-high" title="google:gemini-pro-latest: The Table of Contents is a pixel-perfect match for the headers used in the body of the document. Each entry in the TOC corresponds exactly to a section header.">5</span>

It leaves no major questions about the fictional scenario unanswered.">5</span>
<span class="score-badge score-high" title="openai:gpt-5.1: It covers the EO’s operative provisions, stated justifications, unconstitutional mechanisms, litigation history, systemic implications, concrete harms, and detailed undo steps, leaving little substantive gap.">5</span>

<span class="score-badge score-high" title="openai:gpt-5.1: Language is strongly charged and moralizing—using terms like “blacklist,” “authoritarian template,” and “nefarious plans”—giving the piece a distinctly polemical, high-intensity tone.">5</span>

<span class="score-badge score-low" title="google:gemini-pro-latest: The document relies exclusively on fabricated sources.

<td>Doc B is superior due to its exceptional depth of analysis, which includes a fictional but plausible legal challenge and its outcome. Its use of fabricated but highly realistic primary sources (Federal Register, court dockets) is more sophisticated and convincing than Doc A's reliance on secondary sources. The structure is also a more precise match for the user's instructions, and the clarity is enhanced by better formatting, including a table and bullet points.</td>

<td>Doc A is superior due to its rigorous citation of high-quality, verifiable primary sources, including specific court documents and Federal Register entries, which substantiated its factual claims. It provides a deeper and more nuanced analysis by cross-referencing other executive orders and noting the lack of regulatory implementation. Additionally, Doc A adheres more strictly to the specified 7-part structure and has a perfectly accurate table of contents, unlike Doc B, which has minor structural and formatting deviations and lacks any citations.</td>
