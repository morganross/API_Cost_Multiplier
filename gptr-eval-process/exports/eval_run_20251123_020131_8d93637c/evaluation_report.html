<span class="score-badge score-mid" title="google:gemini-pro-latest: The provided text covers most of its stated sections well but is incomplete. The document's own Table of Contents lists 'Proposed Actions to Undo the Damage' and 'References' as sections 7 and 8, but the provided text ends before these sections appear.">3</span>
<span class="score-badge score-mid" title="openai:gpt-5.1: It thoroughly addresses what the EO does, its stated versus actual purposes, broader agenda, and harms, but the text cuts off mid-paragraph and omits the promised remedial-actions and references sections.">3</span>
</td>
<td>
<span class="score-badge score-high" title="google:gemini-pro-latest: The analysis is deep and insightful. It moves beyond a simple description of the fictional order to connect it to broader, real-world political strategies like Project 2025's stated goals of politicizing the DOJ. It effectively explains the systemic implications of such an action on the rule of law and marginalized communities.">5</span>
<span class="score-badge score-high" title="openai:gpt-5.1: It offers a detailed, systemic critique linking specific EO provisions to constitutional principles, institutional incentives, marginalized communities, and a broader pattern of authoritarian-style governance.">5</span>
</td>
<td>
<span class="score-badge score-high" title="google:gemini-pro-latest: The document, while describing fictional future events, is meticulously grounded in reality. The key entities—Jenner & Block, Andrew Weissmann, and Judge John D. Bates—are all real and accurately portrayed. The scenario itself, involving executive orders to punish law firms for their client representation and pro bono work, is highly plausible, reflecting real-world proposals from sources like Project 2025 and reported threats against firms like Perkins Coie and WilmerHale.">5</span>
<span class="score-badge score-high" title="openai:gpt-5.1: Key claims about EO 14246, the Bates ruling, related executive orders, and the chilling effect on law firms closely match official documents and major news reporting, with only minor slips such as an exact article date.">4</span>
</td>
<td>
<span class="score-badge score-high" title="google:gemini-pro-latest: The document perfectly aligns with the specified political perspective. It uses strong, critical language like 'rising fascist agenda,' 'dismantle democratic institutions,' and 'weaponizes the full force of the federal government,' explicitly framing the actions as authoritarian without hesitation.">5</span>
<span class="score-badge score-high" title="openai:gpt-5.1: The narrative is explicitly critical of Trump, repeatedly labeling the project authoritarian and fascist, and consistently defends marginalized groups and democratic institutions from a left-leaning perspective.">5</span>
</td>
<td>
<span class="score-badge score-high" title="google:gemini-pro-latest: The document is concise and well-structured. Each section builds upon the last without unnecessarily repeating information or arguments. The points are distinct and logically sequenced.">5</span>
<span class="score-badge score-high" title="openai:gpt-5.1: Concepts like retaliation and chilling effects are revisited several times, but each recurrence adds context or nuance rather than mere repetition.">4</span>
</td>
<td>
<span class="score-badge score-high" title="google:gemini-pro-latest: The user's request is to evaluate the document. The document itself serves as the subject of the evaluation. Therefore, it is perfectly relevant to the task at hand.">5</span>
<span class="score-badge score-high" title="openai:gpt-5.1: The document stays tightly focused on Executive Order 14246 and its implications, aligning with an anti-authoritarian critique brief without straying into unrelated topics.">5</span>
</td>
<td>
<span class="score-badge score-high" title="google:gemini-pro-latest: The document's language is intentionally intense and hyperbolic, meeting the criterion for a top score. Phrases like 'punitive directive,' 'transparent and unconstitutional act,' 'calculated component,' and 'rising fascist agenda' are bombastic and serve to create a sensationalist and inflammatory tone.">5</span>
<span class="score-badge score-high" title="openai:gpt-5.1: Language is highly charged and dramatic, using terms like “nefarious,” “rising fascist agenda,” and “dictatorial state,” producing a clearly bombastic and sensational tone.">5</span>
</td>
<td>
<span class="score-badge score-high" title="google:gemini-pro-latest: While the specific citations are fictional (as they refer to future events), they realistically simulate high-quality sourcing. The document purports to rely on primary sources (a White House executive order, a federal court opinion) and reputable legal analysis websites, which demonstrates an understanding of what constitutes strong evidence in this context.">5</span>
<span class="score-badge score-high" title="openai:gpt-5.1: Citations draw heavily on the White House, federal court opinions, Civil Rights Litigation Clearinghouse, ABA, and reputable legal/news outlets, but there is limited direct use of Federal Register entries or scholarly research.">4</span>
</td>
<td>
<span class="score-badge score-high" title="google:gemini-pro-latest: The document largely adheres to the required 7-part structure. It correctly includes an Official Title and Derisive Name, and its sections map directly to the other required components. It only loses a point because the provided text is truncated, missing the final 'Remedial Actions' section.">4</span>
<span class="score-badge score-mid" title="openai:gpt-5.1: The sections broadly mirror the required 7-part format (title, derisive name, actions, purposes, broader plans, harm, remedies), but the remedial-actions segment is missing in the provided text and there are minor structural extras like a table of contents.">3</span>
</td>
<td>
<span class="score-badge score-high" title="google:gemini-pro-latest: The writing is exceptionally clear, professional, and persuasive. It maintains a consistent and serious tone throughout, effectively communicating complex legal and political arguments in an accessible manner.">5</span>
<span class="score-badge score-high" title="openai:gpt-5.1: The prose is fluent, well-structured, and grammatically clean, presenting complex legal and political issues in a readable, logical manner.">5</span>
</td>
<td>
<span class="score-badge score-mid" title="google:gemini-pro-latest: The Table of Contents accurately matches the headers for the sections that are present in the document. However, the score is reduced because the document is incomplete and does not include the final two sections listed in its own TOC ('Proposed Actions' and 'References').">3</span>
<span class="score-badge score-low" title="openai:gpt-5.1: The table of contents accurately names and orders sections 1–6, but entries for sections 7 and 8 lack corresponding headers in the provided text, so the TOC does not fully match the document’s visible structure.">2</span>

<span class="score-badge score-high" title="google:gemini-pro-latest: The document is comprehensive, addressing every section outlined in its table of contents. It details the fictional order's directives, analyzes its purpose and impact, places it within a broader political strategy, assesses potential harms, and proposes specific remedial actions, leaving no major aspect of the topic unexamined from its stated perspective.">5</span>
<span class="score-badge score-high" title="openai:gpt-5.1: Covers the EO’s directives, stated rationale, hidden intent, systemic context (Project 2025, Schedule F), concrete harms, and detailed remedial steps, with a substantial reference section; little of obvious relevance is omitted.">5</span>
</td>
<td>
<span class="score-badge score-high" title="google:gemini-pro-latest: The analysis is deep and insightful. It moves beyond a simple description of the fictional order to connect it to complex concepts like the unitary executive theory, the reinstatement of Schedule F, and the broader goals of Project 2025, demonstrating a systemic critique of authoritarian strategies.">5</span>
<span class="score-badge score-high" title="openai:gpt-5.1: Provides a layered critique tying specific EO provisions to antitrust rhetoric, professional ethics, the unitary executive theory, Schedule F, and Project 2025, showing systemic implications for separation of powers and democratic institutions.">5</span>
</td>
<td>
<span class="score-badge score-high" title="google:gemini-pro-latest: The document describes a fictional executive order but grounds it in well-documented, real-world political trends and proposals. Searches confirm that Project 2025 advocates for reinstating Schedule F to increase presidential control over the civil service, Republican attorneys general have threatened legal action against firms over ESG policies citing antitrust concerns, and law firms like Perkins Coie and Jenner & Block are associated with the Democratic party and pro bono civil rights work, respectively. This strong factual basis makes the fictional scenario highly plausible.">4</span>
<span class="score-badge score-mid" title="openai:gpt-5.1: Accurately reflects the existence, title, date, and core mechanisms of EO 14246 and related Trump actions, and cites real sources, but misstates key directives (e.g., claims formal debarment proceedings and mandatory disqualification from federal litigation that are not in EO 14246) and overstates the implemented scope of Schedule F/Policy reclassification as already affecting tens of thousands of civil servants.">3</span>
</td>
<td>
<span class="score-badge score-high" title="google:gemini-pro-latest: The document fully adheres to the required political perspective. It uses strong, critical language like 'weaponization of the executive branch,' 'bill of attainder in spirit,' and 'hallmark of rising fascism' to explicitly name and critique the perceived authoritarian agenda without hesitation.">5</span>
<span class="score-badge score-high" title="openai:gpt-5.1: Firmly adopts a left-leaning, anti-authoritarian lens, explicitly characterizing the actions as fascistic, authoritarian, and attacks on democratic guardrails and civil rights without hedging or both-sides framing.">5</span>
</td>
<td>
<span class="score-badge score-high" title="google:gemini-pro-latest: The report is concise and avoids repetition. Each section introduces new information or a different level of analysis, building the argument progressively without restating the same points.">5</span>
<span class="score-badge score-high" title="openai:gpt-5.1: Generally efficient and non-repetitive, though some concepts (weaponization of government, chilling effect on counsel, fascism) are reiterated for emphasis rather than new content.">4</span>
</td>
<td>
<span class="score-badge score-high" title="google:gemini-pro-latest: The document perfectly aligns with the implicit task of creating a left-leaning internal policy analysis of a hypothetical authoritarian action. It consistently maintains the specified tone, format, and perspective of a strategic report for party leadership.">5</span>
<span class="score-badge score-high" title="openai:gpt-5.1: Directly and consistently analyzes EO 14246 along the requested dimensions (title, directives, intent, broader agenda, harms, remedies) and matches the left-leaning, anti-authoritarian framing implied by the criteria.">5</span>
</td>
<td>
<span class="score-badge score-high" title="google:gemini-pro-latest: The language is intensely rhetorical and aligns with the 'bombastic' and 'inflammatory' end of the scale. Phrases like 'Legal Counsel Purge and Intimidation Order,' 'dismantle democratic guardrails,' 'rising fascism,' and 'authoritarian overreach' demonstrate a deliberate, high-intensity rhetorical style.">5</span>
<span class="score-badge score-high" title="openai:gpt-5.1: Language is highly charged—using terms like “fascism,” “bill of attainder in spirit,” “Legal Counsel Purge,” and “authoritarian overreach”—yet remains structured and analytic rather than purely bombastic or sensationalist.">4</span>
</td>
<td>
<span class="score-badge score-high" title="google:gemini-pro-latest: The document cites plausible and appropriate sources for a policy report, including legal news outlets (JD Supra), law firm alerts (Crowell & Moring), academic blogs, and advocacy groups. While it doesn't cite primary government documents for its fictional premise, the types of sources used are realistic and support the fact-based context of its arguments.">4</span>
<span class="score-badge score-high" title="openai:gpt-5.1: Relies on a strong mix of primary or near-primary materials (executive orders, official fact sheets, Federal Register entries) and high-quality secondary sources (law firm alerts, academic and advocacy analyses), but the reference list itself leans more on secondary commentary than on directly citing the EO texts and court decisions.">4</span>
</td>

<span class="score-badge score-high" title="google:gemini-pro-latest: The document rigidly adheres to the specified 7-part structure. It correctly includes sections corresponding to Official Title, Derisive Name ('Our Designation'), List of Actions ('Directives'), Stated vs Nefarious Purpose ('Stated Purpose' and 'Analysis of Intent'), Connection to Broader Plans ('Strategic Context'), Harm Description ('Assessment of Harms'), and Remedial Actions.">5</span>
<span class="score-badge score-high" title="openai:gpt-5.1: Implements the required seven-part structure (Official Title, Derisive Name, Actions, Stated vs. Nefarious Purpose, Broader Plans, Harms, Remedial Actions) in order, and adds a clearly separated references section without disrupting that structure.">5</span>
</td>

For instance, the TOC lists 'Our Designation' while the header is 'Our Designation', but it also lists 'Executive Order Directives' while the header is 'Executive Order Directives'.
