<span class="score-badge score-high" title="openai:gpt-5.1: It thoroughly covers the order’s operative sections, official rationale, underlying motives, broader pattern, harms, and proposed remedies, though it could delve further into detailed constitutional doctrine and counterarguments.">4</span>
</td>
<td>
<span class="score-badge score-high" title="google:gemini-pro-latest: The analysis is exceptionally deep, connecting the specific provisions of the order to broader legal and political concepts like 'viewpoint discrimination,' 'chilling effects,' and a systemic strategy of 'plutocratic entrenchment,' demonstrating a high level of critical insight.">5</span>
<span class="score-badge score-high" title="openai:gpt-5.1: The analysis links specific textual provisions to concepts like viewpoint discrimination, economic coercion, chilling effects on pro bono work, and systemic degradation of the adversarial system, situating the EO within a coordinated authoritarian strategy.">5</span>
</td>
<td>
<span class="score-badge score-high" title="google:gemini-pro-latest: Within the user-defined fictional context where the Executive Order is real, the document maintains perfect factual consistency. It accurately cites its provided fictional sources and grounds its narrative in verifiable real-world entities and relationships (e.g., Andrew Weissmann's role in the Mueller probe and his connection to Jenner & Block).">5</span>
<span class="score-badge score-high" title="openai:gpt-5.1: Core claims about EO 14246, its provisions, related orders, and Judge Bates’s ruling closely match official texts and major news accounts, but a few effects are asserted speculatively (e.g., being “cut off from courts,” diversion of “massive resources”) without direct evidentiary support.">4</span>
</td>
<td>
<span class="score-badge score-high" title="google:gemini-pro-latest: The document perfectly embodies the requested perspective, using terms like 'draconian instrument,' 'authoritarian project,' and 'normalization of fascist tactics' to explicitly and fiercely critique the fictional order from an anti-authoritarian viewpoint.">5</span>
<span class="score-badge score-high" title="openai:gpt-5.1: The piece is consistently and explicitly hostile to the Trump administration, describes the orders as authoritarian and fascist, defends civil-rights and DEI advocacy, and avoids neutral or conciliatory framing.">5</span>
</td>
<td>
<span class="score-badge score-high" title="google:gemini-pro-latest: Each section serves a distinct purpose, building the argument without significant repetition. The writing is concise and impactful, avoiding filler or looped content.">5</span>
<span class="score-badge score-high" title="openai:gpt-5.1: Key themes recur but each iteration adds new detail or angle; there is no circular padding, and arguments advance without obvious filler or verbatim repetition.">5</span>
</td>
<td>
<span class="score-badge score-high" title="google:gemini-pro-latest: The document perfectly aligns with its stated rationale of being a 'Gold Standard' report that synthesizes legal analysis with a specific, uncompromising tone. It directly addresses the fictional Executive Order as instructed.">5</span>
<span class="score-badge score-high" title="openai:gpt-5.1: The document squarely analyzes EO 14246 with the requested anti-authoritarian, left-leaning, nearly bombastic frame and is tightly focused on the executive order’s content, context, and implications.">5</span>
</td>
<td>
<span class="score-badge score-high" title="google:gemini-pro-latest: The language is consistently bombastic, inflammatory, and grandiloquent as requested, using phrases like 'state-sponsored vengeance' and 'institutional decapitation' to achieve maximum rhetorical effect.">5</span>
<span class="score-badge score-high" title="openai:gpt-5.1: The language is overtly inflammatory and hyperbolic—using phrases such as “state-sponsored vengeance,” “government-inscribed scarlet letter,” “institutional decapitation,” and “rising fascism”—exactly matching a bombastic, sensationalist register.">5</span>
</td>
<td>
<span class="score-badge score-high" title="google:gemini-pro-latest: Within the fictional scenario, the document relies on the highest quality sources: primary government documents (Federal Register, White House) and reputable legal and news outlets (JURIST, CBS, The Guardian). All claims are appropriately cited to these sources.">5</span>
<span class="score-badge score-high" title="openai:gpt-5.1: Citations center on primary government documents (Federal Register, White House) supplemented by credible legal and mainstream news sources, but the judicial reasoning is mediated mainly through news and summaries rather than the opinion as a primary source.">4</span>
</td>
<td>
<span class="score-badge score-high" title="google:gemini-pro-latest: The document rigidly adheres to the specified 7-part structure (Official Title, Derisive Name, Actions, Stated/Nefarious Purpose, Broader Plans, Harm, Remedial Actions). All required sections are present and in the correct order.">5</span>
<span class="score-badge score-high" title="openai:gpt-5.1: It presents the official title followed by seven numbered sections that map cleanly onto derisive framing, list of actions, stated versus real purposes, broader plans, harms, and remedial actions, plus a closing references section.">5</span>
</td>
<td>
<span class="score-badge score-high" title="google:gemini-pro-latest: The document executes its intended 'nearly bombastic' and professional tone flawlessly. It is highly readable, clear, and maintains a consistent and forceful style throughout without grammatical errors.">5</span>
<span class="score-badge score-high" title="openai:gpt-5.1: Despite very charged rhetoric, the prose is coherent, well-organized, and readable, with clear topic sentences and transitions; occasional long, dense sentences slightly impair ease of reading.">4</span>
</td>
<td>
<span class="score-badge score-high" title="google:gemini-pro-latest: The Table of Contents is a perfect, verbatim match for the corresponding section headers within the document, demonstrating meticulous structural integrity.">5</span>
<span class="score-badge score-high" title="openai:gpt-5.1: The Table of Contents entries, numbering, and wording align exactly with the subsequent section headers, including the references section, with no omissions or mismatches.">5</span>

<span class="score-badge score-high" title="openai:gpt-5.1: It thoroughly addresses the order’s operative mechanisms, stated vs real purposes, connections to Trump’s wider campaign, specific harms, and proposed remedies, yet leaves some potentially relevant angles—such as fuller procedural history, government arguments, and comparative legal doctrines—only lightly sketched.">4</span>
</td>
<td>
<span class="score-badge score-high" title="google:gemini-pro-latest: The analysis is deep and systemic, connecting the specific provisions of EO 14246 to a broader, documented campaign against multiple law firms and linking it to strategies of authoritarian control and intimidation.">5</span>
<span class="score-badge score-high" title="openai:gpt-5.1: The piece moves well beyond description, offering a sophisticated account of how specific legal tools serve a larger authoritarian strategy, including economic coercion of Big Law, chilling effects on pro bono work, and erosion of separation of powers and the right to counsel.">5</span>
</td>
<td>
<span class="score-badge score-high" title="google:gemini-pro-latest: The document's claims about Executive Order 14246, its text, the targeting of Jenner & Block and other law firms, and the subsequent successful legal challenge by Judge John D. Bates are all verified by search results from the Federal Register, news outlets, and legal analyses.">5</span>
<span class="score-badge score-high" title="openai:gpt-5.1: Key claims about EO 14246’s text, its provisions, related executive orders, and the Jenner & Block litigation closely track the official White House order, fact sheet, court rulings, and major news coverage; I found no concrete factual errors or fabrications.">5</span>
</td>
<td>
<span class="score-badge score-high" title="google:gemini-pro-latest: The document fiercely adheres to a left-leaning perspective, explicitly framing the executive order as a component of an 'authoritarian project,' 'naked political reprisal,' and an 'assault on separation of powers.'">5</span>
<span class="score-badge score-high" title="openai:gpt-5.1: The document squarely frames the order as retaliatory, plutocratic, and authoritarian, explicitly condemns the administration’s agenda, and consistently adopts a pro–civil-rights, anti-fascist stance with no neutralizing or both-sides framing.">5</span>
</td>

<span class="score-badge score-high" title="google:gemini-pro-latest: The document is well-structured and concise. Each section builds upon the previous one without significant repetition of arguments or information.">5</span>
<span class="score-badge score-mid" title="openai:gpt-5.1: Several core ideas—suspension of clearances, contract blacklisting, and retaliation for protected advocacy—are reiterated across multiple sections in similar terms, producing noticeable but not overwhelming repetition.">3</span>
</td>

<span class="score-badge score-high" title="google:gemini-pro-latest: The document functions as a detailed analysis of a specific executive order, which is the implicit user query. It perfectly follows the instructions to analyze the provided document, assuming the persona of a critical reviewer.">5</span>
<span class="score-badge score-high" title="openai:gpt-5.1: The analysis stays tightly focused on EO 14246 and its broader implications from a critical left perspective, but it does not mirror the exact 7-labeled section scheme originally specified, so alignment with detailed formatting instructions is slightly imperfect.">4</span>
</td>
<td>
<span class="score-badge score-high" title="google:gemini-pro-latest: The language is consistently grandiloquent and inflammatory, using phrases like 'draconian decree,' 'economic strangulation,' 'naked political reprisal,' 'presidential vengeance,' and 'government-inscribed scarlet letter' to create a sensationalist tone.">5</span>
<span class="score-badge score-high" title="openai:gpt-5.1: The language is overtly polemical and vivid—describing ‘blacklist directives,’ ‘economic subjugation,’ and a ‘coherent authoritarian project’—showing sustained bombast and emotional charge throughout.">5</span>
</td>
<td>
<span class="score-badge score-high" title="google:gemini-pro-latest: The document relies on high-quality primary and secondary sources, including the Federal Register for the text of the EO, established news organizations (AP, JURIST), and legal encyclopedias, all of which are appropriate for this type of analysis.">5</span>
<span class="score-badge score-high" title="openai:gpt-5.1: It cites high-quality primary or near-primary sources (official White House materials, major court coverage, reputable legal and news outlets) but leans materially on Wikipedia and secondary reporting rather than consistently anchoring key legal claims in the Federal Register and judicial opinions themselves.">4</span>
</td>
<td>
<span class="score-badge score-high" title="google:gemini-pro-latest: The document rigidly adheres to the specified 7-part structure, with each section title in the Table of Contents and the body matching the conceptual requirements of the evaluation criteria (e.g., Stated vs Nefarious Purpose, Harm Description, Remedial Actions).">5</span>
<span class="score-badge score-mid" title="openai:gpt-5.1: The content maps conceptually onto the requested elements (title, actions, purposes, broader plans, harms, remedies) but rearranges them into an 8-part outline and lacks a clearly demarcated standalone ‘Derisive Name’ section matching the prescribed 7-part format and order.">3</span>
</td>
<td>
<span class="score-badge score-high" title="google:gemini-pro-latest: The writing is exceptionally clear, professional, and persuasive, adopting a consistent and serious analytical tone appropriate for the subject matter. The flow is logical and easy to follow.">5</span>
<span class="score-badge score-high" title="openai:gpt-5.1: The writing is coherent, well-organized, and professional, but its dense, highly charged prose and long paragraphs occasionally obscure the underlying legal points and make the argument less immediately accessible than it could be.">4</span>

<span class="score-badge score-high" title="google:gemini-pro-latest: The document is very thorough, covering the order's text, its stated and actual purpose, the harm it caused, and potential remedies. It could have been slightly more complete by naming the specific judge (John D. Bates) or the court (U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia).">4</span>
<span class="score-badge score-mid" title="openai:gpt-5.1: Covers the EO’s operative provisions, stated vs actual purpose, systemic context, harms, and proposed remedies, but omits important legal details (e.g., procedural history, government defenses, status of the appeal, and interaction with clearance/contract law) that an expert analysis would include.">3</span>
</td>
<td>
<span class="score-badge score-high" title="google:gemini-pro-latest: The analysis is deep, connecting the specific punitive actions against one law firm to a broader, systemic strategy of eroding judicial checks and balances, which it explicitly labels as a move toward authoritarianism.">5</span>
<span class="score-badge score-high" title="openai:gpt-5.1: Connects specific provisions to systemic attacks on the bar, separation of powers, and authoritarian patterns, using judicial and ABA language; however, it does not deeply engage doctrinal nuances, counterarguments, or comparative institutional analysis that would mark truly expert depth.">4</span>
</td>
<td>
<span class="score-badge score-high" title="google:gemini-pro-latest: The document's claims about Executive Order 14246 are exceptionally accurate. Web searches confirm the EO was issued on March 25, 2025, targeted Jenner & Block, mentioned Andrew Weissmann, and listed punitive actions like suspending security clearances. A federal court did enjoin the order, and the ABA did file a broader lawsuit against the administration's policy of targeting law firms.">5</span>
<span class="score-badge score-high" title="openai:gpt-5.1: Core claims about EO 14246’s date, content, stated justifications, the Bates ruling, the 40% contractor income figure, and the ABA lawsuit all match official and reputable sources; minor imprecision (e.g., framing 40% as general revenue and omitting that the permanent injunction is on appeal) keeps it from a perfect score.">4</span>
</td>
<td>
<span class="score-badge score-high" title="google:gemini-pro-latest: The document perfectly embodies the requested political perspective, using terms like 'draconian,' 'authoritarianism,' and 'rising fascism' to fiercely critique the administration's actions without hesitation.">5</span>
<span class="score-badge score-high" title="openai:gpt-5.1: Unambiguously frames the order as authoritarian and a hallmark of rising fascism, foregrounds threats to rule of law and vulnerable groups, and offers no ‘both-sides’ equivocation, fully matching a left-leaning, anti-fascist stance.">5</span>
</td>
<td>
<span class="score-badge score-high" title="google:gemini-pro-latest: The document is concise and effective. Each section introduces new information or a different angle of analysis, with no significant repetition or filler.">5</span>
<span class="score-badge score-high" title="openai:gpt-5.1: Key themes (retaliation, chilling effect, authoritarianism) are reiterated across sections but generally with new angles or details; there is some rhetorical repetition but little outright filler.">4</span>
</td>

<span class="score-badge score-high" title="openai:gpt-5.1: Stays tightly focused on EO 14246, its mechanisms, intents, harms, and remedies from a critical perspective; however, slight deviation from the fully specified 7-part brief format means it does not follow every constraint perfectly.">4</span>
</td>
<td>
<span class="score-badge score-high" title="google:gemini-pro-latest: The rhetoric is exceptionally intense and grandiloquent, employing bombastic and sensationalist language such as 'unprecedented assault,' 'vindictive campaign,' and 'systemic dismantling of the rule of law' to create a dramatic and inflammatory effect.">5</span>
<span class="score-badge score-high" title="openai:gpt-5.1: Language is consistently highly charged and sensationalist—using terms like ‘draconian,’ ‘vindictive campaign,’ ‘systemic dismantling of the rule of law,’ and ‘hallmark of rising fascism’—reaching maximal bombast rather than measured critique.">5</span>
</td>
<td>
<span class="score-badge score-mid" title="google:gemini-pro-latest: While the facts presented are verifiable against high-quality news and legal sources, the document itself does not cite any primary sources like the Federal Register or specific court filings.

<span class="score-badge score-high" title="openai:gpt-5.1: Substantive claims align with high-quality primary and secondary sources (Federal Register/White House text, federal court opinion, ABA filings, major news outlets), but these sources are only implicit in the narrative and not explicitly cited or referenced by name or docket in the document itself.">4</span>
</td>
<td>
<span class="score-badge score-high" title="google:gemini-pro-latest: The document rigidly adheres to the specified 7-part structure, with each heading corresponding directly to a required component (e.g., 'A Catalog of Punitive Measures' for List of Actions, 'Stated Pretext vs. Nefarious Reality' for Stated vs Nefarious Purpose).">5</span>
<span class="score-badge score-high" title="openai:gpt-5.1: Includes the official title and clearly mapped sections for derisive framing, list of actions, stated vs nefarious purpose, broader plan, harms, and remedies in the correct logical order, though the ‘Derisive Name’ is embedded as a narrative heading rather than a distinctly labeled segment.">4</span>
