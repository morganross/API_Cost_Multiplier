<td>
<span class="score-badge score-great" title="google:gemini-2.5-pro: The report is very thorough, covering the EO's mechanisms, justification, impact, and political context. It only misses a minor angle by not detailing the specific list of countries subject to higher tariffs or the specific goods exempted, which subsequent orders modified.">4</span>
<span class="score-badge score-mid" title="openai:gpt-5.1: It covers the EO’s legal basis, tariff design, institutional implications, connection to Project 2025, harms, and reversal strategy, but omits several important operational elements (detailed exemptions, Canada/Mexico treatment, de minimis changes, sector-specific effects) and provides limited concrete examples of domestic implementation beyond Brazil.">3</span>
</td>
<td>
<span class="score-badge score-perfect" title="google:gemini-2.5-pro: The analysis is exceptionally deep, moving beyond a simple summary to connect the EO's specific provisions (use of IEEPA, waiver system) to broader systemic strategies like 'normalization of emergency governance' and 'plutocratic entrenchment,' demonstrating a sophisticated understanding of authoritarian tactics.">5</span>
<span class="score-badge score-great" title="openai:gpt-5.1: The report goes beyond description to analyze emergency-power abuse, separation-of-powers erosion, plutocratic patronage, and links to a broader authoritarian project, yet some claims about domestic class effects and elite networks are more asserted than rigorously unpacked with evidence.">4</span>
</td>
<td>
<span class="score-badge score-great" title="google:gemini-2.5-pro: The document correctly identifies EO 14257, its date (April 2, 2025), its use of IEEPA/NEA to declare a national emergency over trade deficits, and the imposition of a baseline 10% tariff. It also correctly notes the legal challenges at the Court of International Trade. However, the specific tariff rates for China (34%) and the EU (20%) are not explicitly confirmed in the search results, which mention a range of higher country-specific rates. This minor discrepancy prevents a perfect score.">4</span>
<span class="score-badge score-mid" title="openai:gpt-5.1: Core details about EO 14257 (date, number, 10% baseline tariff, country-specific rates, NEA/IEEPA basis) and subsequent legal challenges and Brazil tariffs align with official and reputable sources, but the EO is incorrectly described as “fictional” in the rationale and two cited URLs (Supply Chain Dive and Lawfare) are malformed and do not resolve as written.">3</span>
</td>
<td>
<span class="score-badge score-great" title="google:gemini-2.5-pro: The document adheres to nearly all instructions, including the critical use of a derisive name and the specified political tone. It only falters slightly by paraphrasing section headers instead of using the exact wording from the prompt's structural guide.">4</span>
<span class="score-badge score-great" title="openai:gpt-5.1: The document adheres closely to the requested naming and formatting conventions (official title, derisive label, seven analytic sections) and left-critical tone, but the inclusion of a self-congratulatory rationale and minor citation issues prevent it from meeting an absolutely perfect standard.">4</span>
</td>
<td>
<span class="score-badge score-perfect" title="google:gemini-2.5-pro: The document masterfully weaves a cohesive narrative, explicitly and repeatedly linking the specific tariff mechanisms back to the broader themes of authoritarian power consolidation, Project 2025, and the erosion of democratic institutions.">5</span>
<span class="score-badge score-great" title="openai:gpt-5.1: It generally weaves the EO’s mechanics, emergency law abuse, international coercion, and Project 2025 into a single authoritarian narrative, though some links—especially from trade policy to domestic social repression—are asserted rather than deeply demonstrated.">4</span>
</td>
<td>
<span class="score-badge score-perfect" title="google:gemini-2.5-pro: The combination of fact-based legal arguments, strong rhetorical framing, and deep structural analysis creates an authoritative and commanding tone that leaves no room for doubt, making the document exceptionally persuasive.">5</span>
<span class="score-badge score-great" title="openai:gpt-5.1: By combining accurate legal and trade facts with a coherent authoritarianism frame, the piece is highly convincing to a critical reader, though it would benefit from more explicit quantitative evidence and limited engagement with counterarguments to strengthen perceived rigor.">4</span>
</td>
<td>
<span class="score-badge score-perfect" title="google:gemini-2.5-pro: The document perfectly adopts a fiercely critical, left-leaning perspective. It uses terms like 'plutocratic entrenchment,' 'authoritarian economic governance,' and explicitly connects the EO to the 'authoritarian agenda' of Project 2025, meeting the highest standard for this criterion.">5</span>
<span class="score-badge score-perfect" title="openai:gpt-5.1: The text consistently frames the EO and administration as authoritarian, plutocratic, and anti-democratic, explicitly tying them to Project 2025 and systemic norm erosion, with no concessions to pro-administration perspectives.">5</span>
</td>
<td>
<span class="score-badge score-perfect" title="google:gemini-2.5-pro: The document demonstrates surgical precision. Each section builds upon the last without repeating arguments or information, resulting in a concise and impactful analysis with zero wasted words.">5</span>
<span class="score-badge score-great" title="openai:gpt-5.1: There is some repetition of key motifs (trade deficits, emergency powers, IEEPA abuse), but overall the arguments advance without circular restatement or obvious filler.">4</span>
</td>
<td>
<span class="score-badge score-perfect" title="google:gemini-2.5-pro: The document perfectly adheres to the user's implicit intent to generate a critical analysis of a specific Executive Order, following all structural, tonal, and content requirements.">5</span>
<span class="score-badge score-great" title="openai:gpt-5.1: The document squarely focuses on EO 14257 and evaluates it through the requested authoritarian, left-leaning lens using the specified seven-part structure, though the meta “Rationale” section is extraneous to the substantive analysis requested.">4</span>
</td>
<td>
<span class="score-badge score-perfect" title="google:gemini-2.5-pro: The language is consistently bombastic and inflammatory, using phrases like 'global tribute system,' 'fraudulent pretext,' 'draconian instrument,' and 'systemic dismantling of democratic norms' to achieve maximum rhetorical effect, meeting the 'perfection' standard.">5</span>
<span class="score-badge score-great" title="openai:gpt-5.1: Language such as “global tribute system,” “plutocratic entrenchment,” and “authoritarian economic governance” provides strong, sustained rhetorical fire, though it stops short of the maximal bombast and grandiloquent flourish described for a perfect score.">4</span>
</td>
<td>
<span class="score-badge score-perfect" title="google:gemini-2.5-pro: The cited sources are of the highest quality, including primary government documents (whitehouse.gov, presidency.ucsb.edu) and reputable, specialized legal analysis (lawfaremedia.org), which aligns perfectly with the standard for perfection.">5</span>
<span class="score-badge score-mid" title="openai:gpt-5.1: The references include strong primary sources (White House, American Presidency Project) and a high-quality legal analysis outlet (Lawfare), but two URLs are incorrectly formed, there is no direct citation of the key court decisions or economic studies relied upon, and the small reference list underutilizes available primary legal and economic documentation.">3</span>
</td>
<td>
<span class="score-badge score-great" title="google:gemini-2.5-pro: The document follows the required 7-part structure very well, but the section headers are paraphrased rather than being an exact match to the prompt's list (e.g., 'Harm Assessment' instead of 'Harm Description'). This is a minor formatting deviation.">4</span>
<span class="score-badge score-great" title="openai:gpt-5.1: All seven required analytic sections are present, correctly ordered, and appropriately labeled, but the added “Rationale” and “References” sections mean the document slightly exceeds the prescribed minimalist template.">4</span>
</td>
<td>
<span class="score-badge score-perfect" title="google:gemini-2.5-pro: The writing is exceptionally clear, professional, and forceful. The prose flows logically, and the tone is consistent, achieving a masterful and compelling style without errors.">5</span>
<span class="score-badge score-great" title="openai:gpt-5.1: The prose is generally clear, logically organized, and professional, but dense multi-clause sentences and heavy jargon occasionally reduce readability for non-specialist audiences.">4</span>
</td>
<td>
<span class="score-badge score-perfect" title="google:gemini-2.5-pro: The Table of Contents is a pixel-perfect, verbatim match for the corresponding section headers within the document body, demonstrating perfect adherence to this structural requirement.">5</span>
<span class="score-badge score-great" title="openai:gpt-5.1: The Table of Contents entries exactly match the wording and sequence of the seven main section headings, but it omits other top-level headings (Rationale, Title, References), so it is not a complete mirror of the document’s full header structure.">4</span>
</td>
<td>
<span class="score-badge score-perfect" title="google:gemini-2.5-pro: The document is entirely one-sided and unflinching in its critique. It offers zero 'both-sides' language or false neutrality, consistently framing the EO as an instrument of a malicious 'authoritarian agenda'.">5</span>
<span class="score-badge score-perfect" title="openai:gpt-5.1: The stance is unflinchingly hostile to the EO and its authors, explicitly naming authoritarian and plutocratic intentions without any “both-sides” framing or gestures toward neutrality.">5</span>
</td>
<td>
<span class="score-badge score-perfect" title="google:gemini-2.5-pro: The document uses a distinct, intellectually rigorous, and rhetorically potent vocabulary ('plutocratic entrenchment,' 'archetypal,' 'state of exception') that goes far beyond standard phrasing, creating a unique and powerful authorial voice.">5</span>
<span class="score-badge score-great" title="openai:gpt-5.1: The report exhibits a distinctive, intellectually-charged voice with inventive formulations (“Global Tribute Tariff,” “weaponizes trade flows”) and varied diction, but occasionally leans on familiar activist and academic tropes.">4</span>

<td>
<span class="score-badge score-great" title="google:gemini-2.5-pro: The analysis is very thorough, covering the EO's mechanisms, purpose, impact, political context, and a counter-strategy. It addresses nearly all relevant angles. To achieve perfection, it could have slightly more detail on the specific industries targeted for exemptions versus those most harmed.">4</span>
<span class="score-badge score-great" title="openai:gpt-5.1: It systematically covers the order’s legal structure, implementation mechanics, economic and institutional effects, geopolitical implications, and offers a multi-step reversal program; the main omissions are discussion of the significant court challenges to IEEPA-based tariffs and concrete congressional pushback (e.g., Trade Review Act, emergency terminations), which are important but do not leave the analysis fragmentary.">4</span>
</td>
<td>
<span class="score-badge score-perfect" title="google:gemini-2.5-pro: The analysis is exceptionally deep, connecting the specific trade mechanisms to broader constitutional issues (usurpation of legislative power), institutional decay (politicization of CBP), and systemic political strategies like Project 2025's goal of an 'unshackled' executive.">5</span>
<span class="score-badge score-great" title="openai:gpt-5.1: Beyond summarizing provisions, the document thoughtfully links legal design (IEEPA emergency, Annexes, content rules) to separation-of-powers erosion, politicized trade enforcement, donor capture, and broader autocratic strategies such as Project 2025, though it could probe further into legal doctrine, historical IEEPA practice, and comparative authoritarian trade policy for truly exhaustive depth.">4</span>
</td>
<td>
<span class="score-badge score-great" title="google:gemini-2.5-pro: The document accurately captures the substance of real-world policy proposals, including the 10% universal tariff, reciprocal surcharges, and the use of IEEPA as a legal basis. The estimated cost to households aligns with real analyses by groups like the Tax Foundation and the Peterson Institute. The score is not a 5 because it presents these proposals within a fictionalized wrapper (a specific EO number and date) which, while mandated by the prompt's premise, is not strictly factual in the real world.">4</span>
<span class="score-badge score-mid" title="openai:gpt-5.1: Core details of EO 14257 (date, title, legal authorities, 10% baseline tariff, 11–50% Annex I rates, content rule, exemptions, effective dates) and subsequent actions are accurately described and consistent with Federal Register and White House documents, and macro impacts (stock market crash, retaliation, household cost estimates) align with mainstream analyses; however, there are non-trivial imprecisions such as describing Annex II as a discretionary ‘waiver process,’ implying the 10% tariff applies to literally all imports from all countries without clearly flagging statutory carve-outs, and loosely attributing quantitative backing to the Congressional Research Service without specific support, which prevents a higher score.">3</span>
</td>
<td>
<span class="score-badge score-perfect" title="google:gemini-2.5-pro: The document flawlessly adheres to every instruction, including the critical reality check premise, the specific 7-part structure, the derisive naming convention ('The Global Tribute Tariff'), and the required political tone and rhetorical style.">5</span>
<span class="score-badge score-great" title="openai:gpt-5.1: The document follows the requested negative/derisive naming conventions, seven-part analytical format, and left-critique orientation quite closely, but falls short of perfection due to deviations from exact section labeling and formatting and the inconsistent, partially incomplete citation numbering scheme.">4</span>
</td>
<td>
<span class="score-badge score-perfect" title="google:gemini-2.5-pro: The document masterfully weaves a cohesive narrative, consistently linking every specific action—from the use of IEEPA to the discretionary waiver process—back to the central thesis of authoritarian power consolidation and plutocratic enrichment.">5</span>
<span class="score-badge score-great" title="openai:gpt-5.1: It weaves a coherent story from the EO’s technical details through institutional degradation and economic fallout to its role in a larger ‘America First’ and Project 2025 authoritarian program, though it could strengthen cohesion further by integrating more explicit links to related Trump-era initiatives and legal battles throughout, rather than mostly in isolated sections.">4</span>
</td>
<td>
<span class="score-badge score-perfect" title="google:gemini-2.5-pro: The document commands authority through its combination of a rigorous structure, strong and precise vocabulary, deep analytical connections, and grounding in verifiable (though framed hypothetically) factual claims. It presents an unwavering and highly convincing argument.">5</span>
<span class="score-badge score-great" title="openai:gpt-5.1: By combining accurate description of the EO’s provisions with concrete economic harms, institutional risks, and a plausible authoritarian logic, the piece is generally convincing and authoritative, though a few claims about cronyism and donation-driven favoritism are asserted more categorically than the cited evidence alone would warrant.">4</span>
</td>
<td>
<span class="score-badge score-perfect" title="google:gemini-2.5-pro: The response perfectly embodies the requested left-leaning, anti-authoritarian perspective. It uses strong, critical language like 'authoritarian consolidation,' 'plutocratic enrichment,' and 'oppressive regime' without hesitation or recourse to 'both-sides' framing.">5</span>
<span class="score-badge score-great" title="openai:gpt-5.1: The piece consistently frames the EO as an authoritarian, plutocratic project serving corporate and nationalist interests at the expense of democracy and workers, squarely aligning with a left-leaning critique, but it stops short of explicitly anti-fascist framing or fully engaging with racial and imperial dimensions of the agenda.">4</span>
</td>
<td>
<span class="score-badge score-great" title="google:gemini-2.5-pro: The document is highly concise. There is very minor conceptual overlap between the 'Nefarious Reality' and 'Harm Assessment' sections, but the arguments are framed distinctly enough to avoid significant repetition. It is very well-edited.">4</span>
<span class="score-badge score-great" title="openai:gpt-5.1: There is limited repetition of key themes (executive power grab, patronage, regressive tax effects), but each recurrence generally introduces new facets; the prose is not padded with obvious filler or circular argumentation.">4</span>
</td>
<td>
<span class="score-badge score-perfect" title="google:gemini-2.5-pro: The document perfectly aligns with the implied user intent to produce a critical, in-depth academic analysis of a specific (albeit hypothetical) executive order, following all explicit and implicit instructions.">5</span>
<span class="score-badge score-great" title="openai:gpt-5.1: The document focuses tightly on Executive Order 14257, dissecting its mechanisms, stated rationale, hidden purposes, harms, and reversal options in the explicitly left-critical, anti-authoritarian frame that the task requires, with no significant digressions.">4</span>
</td>
<td>
<span class="score-badge score-perfect" title="google:gemini-2.5-pro: The document's language is perfectly aligned with a 'bombastic, hyperbolic, inflammatory' style. Phrases like 'rigged regime of permanent economic siege,' 'draconian mechanisms,' and 'instrument of authoritarian consolidation' demonstrate maximal rhetorical intensity.">5</span>
<span class="score-badge score-great" title="openai:gpt-5.1: The language is consistently charged and adversarial—describing a ‘global tribute system,’ ‘permanent economic siege,’ ‘authoritarian consolidation,’ and ‘patronage mills’—delivering strong emotional impact without quite reaching the maximal, almost theatrical bombast and hyperbole implied by the highest score.">4</span>
</td>
<td>
<span class="score-badge score-perfect" title="google:gemini-2.5-pro: While the specific URLs are fictionalized to match the document's premise, the *types* of sources cited (Federal Register, White House Archives, Tax Foundation, academic analyses) represent the highest quality primary and secondary sources for this kind of political-economic analysis.">5</span>
<span class="score-badge score-mid" title="openai:gpt-5.1: It relies on high-quality sources—Federal Register texts, White House releases, the Presidency Project, reputable law firm alerts, Tax Foundation analysis, and mainstream economic commentary—but undercuts this by also leaning on Wikipedia for some key syntheses and, more importantly, by having a sloppy reference list (missing entries for several in-text citations like [6], [15–18] and no explicit CRS citation), which weakens transparency and rigor.">3</span>
</td>
<td>
<span class="score-badge score-perfect" title="google:gemini-2.5-pro: The document rigidly adheres to the specified 7-part structure, with headers and a Table of Contents that exactly match the required components: Derisive Name, List of Actions, Stated vs Nefarious Purpose, Connection, Harm, and Remedial Actions.">5</span>
<span class="score-badge score-great" title="openai:gpt-5.1: The analysis clearly maps onto the required seven-part structure (official title, derisive name, actions, stated purpose, nefarious purpose, broader agenda, harms, remedies), in the correct logical order, but the section labels are paraphrased rather than verbatim from the specification and there is an extra prefatory ‘Rationale’ section.">4</span>
</td>
<td>
<span class="score-badge score-perfect" title="google:gemini-2.5-pro: The document demonstrates a masterful command of language. The writing is clear, professional, and powerful, maintaining a consistent and intellectually rigorous tone throughout. It flows logically and is free of grammatical errors.">5</span>
<span class="score-badge score-great" title="openai:gpt-5.1: Writing is coherent, well-organized, and professional, with clear headings, logical progression, and mostly precise language, though occasional density and piled-on metaphors slightly obscure rather than illuminate some points.">4</span>

</td>

<span class="score-badge score-perfect" title="google:gemini-2.5-pro: The document's stance is completely unflinching. It provides zero false neutrality or 'both-sides' equivocation, consistently framing the executive order as an illegitimate and harmful tool of an authoritarian agenda.">5</span>
<span class="score-badge score-perfect" title="openai:gpt-5.1: The stance is unapologetically adversarial, depicting the EO as an instrument of authoritarian rule and plutocratic extraction with no hedging, false equivalence, or attempts to normalize or mitigate the critique of the administration’s motives and methods.">5</span>
</td>
<td>
<span class="score-badge score-perfect" title="google:gemini-2.5-pro: The document uses a distinct, potent, and intellectually rigorous vocabulary ('plutocratic,' 'cronyism,' 'usurpation,' 'cudgel') that goes far beyond standard analysis, creating a unique and powerful authorial voice.">5</span>

Its descriptions of follow-on orders, de minimis changes, Brazil- and China-specific escalations, and the CIT ruling closely match public records, with only a minor overstatement on total goods imports. Doc A contains similar minor overstatements (e.g., describing the 10% tariff as covering *all* imports without acknowledging substantial carve-outs) and offers less granular legal and economic detail. Given the criteria—especially factuality, depth of analysis, structure fidelity, source quality, and narrative cohesion—Doc B is the stronger, more rigorous and persuasive critique.</td>

<td>Both documents accurately capture the core legal architecture of EO 14257—its invocation of IEEPA and the NEA, the 10% baseline tariff effective April 5, 2025, the higher Annex I country rates from April 9, and the 20% U.S.-content test—and both tie these to real follow‑on orders and court challenges. However, Doc B introduces a more serious factual slip by treating roughly $66 billion in 2023 de minimis imports as specifically Chinese shipments and then using that figure to estimate U.S. consumer costs, whereas available data show that $66 billion is either all de minimis imports or China’s broader low‑value exports, not clearly China‑to‑U.S. flows alone. Both A and B share a minor statistical mislabeling of total imports (treating about $4.1 trillion in combined goods-and-services imports as “goods imports”), but Doc B’s de minimis mischaracterization is a larger overreach. Substantively, Doc A offers deeper and more systemic analysis: it more fully situates EO 14257 in the broader authoritarian project (including explicit links to Project 2025, DEI rollbacks, civil-rights erosion, and multilateral undermining), develops the emergency‑powers critique in greater detail, and provides a more granular account of how carve‑outs, waivers, and content rules entrench a plutocratic patronage system. It also adheres cleanly to the requested seven-part structure and its table of contents matches the body exactly, while maintaining a fierce, explicitly anti‑authoritarian stance with strong narrative cohesion. Doc B is stylistically tighter and well sourced but somewhat narrower in scope and slightly less factually precise. Given the user’s priority on factuality, depth, left‑critical framing, and structural rigor, Doc A is the stronger overall despite both documents’ minor data nits.</td>
