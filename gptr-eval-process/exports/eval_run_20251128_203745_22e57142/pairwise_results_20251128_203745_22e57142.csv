Doc A contains clear factual errors and hallucinations, most notably calling EO 14265 an “ungrounded” order despite its well‑documented existence and wrongly attributing to EO 14151 an explicit ban on considering race/sex in federal hiring that actually stems from other orders, which disqualifies it under the stated standards. Beyond superior factuality, Doc B offers deeper, more specific systemic analysis and better adherence to the required 7‑part structure with minimal redundancy.",2025-11-28T20:45:51.524445Z

Doc A, although generally accurate about EO 14151 and richer in sourcing, contains at least one clear factual error by calling EO 14265 an “ungrounded” order and also blurs which DEI‑related prohibitions come from EO 14151 versus companion orders; under the given instructions, those hallucinations disqualify it, so Doc B is the stronger overall choice.",2025-11-28T20:45:51.596942Z

It is superior in its use of specific, verifiable policy details (e.g., 'Other Transactions Authority,' 'MDAPs') which demonstrates a higher level of factual grounding and research compared to the more generalized claims in Doc A.",2025-11-28T20:46:31.264465Z

Its key verifiable details—the EO number, title, and specific Federal Register citation—were all confirmed by web searches. Doc B, while generally accurate, conflated its subject EO with a 'ten-for-one' rule from a different executive order, a notable factual error. Furthermore, Doc A provided high-quality sources and adhered more closely to the requested structure, whereas Doc B failed to cite any sources and contained significant formatting errors in its table of contents.",2025-11-28T20:46:31.271709Z

Its claims are substantiated with specific, verifiable citations that align with web search results, demonstrating superior factuality and source quality. Document B, while factually accurate on the single EO it covers, lacks any citations and offers a less insightful analysis.",2025-11-28T20:46:31.282551Z
