Doc B, however, attributes to this EO several sweeping directives—expanded interagency surveillance mandates, cross‑border law‑enforcement and paramilitary operations, and explicit secondary-sanctions instructions for foreign banks—that do not appear in EO 14157 or any linked primary documents; those are hallucinated policy details, which under the evaluation rules disqualify Doc B from winning despite its otherwise strong analysis and sourcing.",2025-11-29T06:20:58.670127Z

By contrast, Doc B, while grounded in the real EO 14157, repeatedly attributes specific measures to that order that do not appear in the White House or Federal Register text—such as creating explicit intelligence-sharing directives, mandating expanded surveillance and cross‑border operations, and directing secondary sanctions on foreign financial institutions—thereby fabricating authorities and implementation details. Under the user’s standard that any hallucinated claims disqualify a document, Doc B cannot win despite its analytical strengths; Doc A is the better, factually grounded and structurally compliant critique.",2025-11-29T06:20:58.677685Z
