Under the user’s strict no‑hallucination rule, that error disqualifies Doc A from winning.",2025-11-29T06:45:24.628832Z

Its inclusion of an 'Analysis & Evidence Chain' and 'Judgments of severity' provides a methodical, verifiable breakdown of its arguments that Doc A lacks. Furthermore, Doc B integrates both Executive Orders more comprehensively and accurately identifies specific details, such as the EO number for the 'Ending Crime' order and the correct signing date for the Alien Enemies Act proclamation, making it more factually precise and complete.",2025-11-29T06:46:07.647252Z

Doc B's claims were more general, but more importantly, it relied on suspicious, future-dated citations that undermine its credibility.

It analyzes two interconnected executive orders, demonstrating a sophisticated understanding of how foreign and domestic policy tools are being combined. Its structured, evidence-based analysis is more rigorous and persuasive than Document B's more rhetorical approach, which only covers a single order and thus misses the broader strategic picture.",2025-11-29T06:46:07.663091Z
