By contrast, Doc B, while stylistically strong and largely grounded in the real tariff order, introduces at least one clear factual error about China’s retaliatory tariff rate and lacks citations, which, under the stated rules, disqualifies it from being the better overall document.",2025-11-29T09:52:42.379178Z

Its central claims, including the exact name and number of the Executive Order (14266), the 125% tariff on China, the 10% baseline tariff, and the use of the IEEPA as legal justification, are all precisely corroborated by the web search results. Doc A is also well-founded, but Doc B's use of multiple, interconnected, and verifiable quantitative details gives it a decisive edge in depth and accuracy.",2025-11-29T09:53:19.464174Z

It substantiates its claims with citations to credible sources like the Tax Foundation, Reuters, and legal analyses, which web searches confirm are authoritative on this topic. Its reversal strategy is detailed, specific, and grounded in actual statutes, demonstrating a much deeper level of analysis and adherence to the 'critical academic' persona than Document A, which relies on unsupported assertions.",2025-11-29T09:53:19.483091Z
