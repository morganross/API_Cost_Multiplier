Doc A, though rhetorically powerful, is less sourced and contains at least one factual slip by misattributing specific Charlie Kirk and “Radical Left violence” language to the Antifa EO fact sheet, so it cannot outrank B under strict factuality and anti-hallucination standards.",2025-11-29T10:13:16.373822Z

However, Document B is superior due to its meticulous sourcing with inline citations to verifiable government documents and expert analyses. Its structure is flawless, with a perfect match between the table of contents and headers, and it provides a more detailed and legally grounded reversal strategy. The depth of its legal and economic analysis is greater, lending it more authority and persuasiveness than Document A.",2025-11-29T10:13:50.455866Z
