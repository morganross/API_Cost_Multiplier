While Doc A is strong, it contains a minor interpretive claim regarding 'in-state tuition' that is not explicitly verified by external sources, making Doc B's factual accuracy impeccable. Both documents excel in rhetorical intensity, critical analysis, and adherence to the specified left-leaning political stance, but Doc B's absolute precision in factual claims makes it slightly stronger under the 'extremely strict' judgment standard.",2025-11-30T01:31:26.049496Z
