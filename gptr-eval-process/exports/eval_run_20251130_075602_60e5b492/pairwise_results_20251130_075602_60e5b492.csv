Its description of what the EO does—180‑day FAR rewrite, ‘statutory roots’ minimalism, four‑year sunset for non‑statutory provisions, agency liaisons, the ten‑for‑one rule, and the use of government‑wide class deviations and non‑regulatory guidance—matches official documents in both content and detail. By contrast, Doc A attributes to EO 14275 several mechanisms that do not appear in the order or documented implementation (e.g., creation of “National Priority Vendor” designations, mandated ‘viewpoint neutrality’ clauses in contracts and grants, and explicit cross‑referencing of NSPM‑7 and domestic‑terrorism vetting in procurement). Those are substantial fabrications about this specific EO, even though its citations on other Trump actions are generally real. Under the user’s strict standards, these hallucinated features disqualify Doc A, while Doc B remains factually solid, structurally compliant, and analytically deep despite minor memo-number sloppiness.",2025-11-30T08:00:29.619152Z

By contrast, Doc A repeatedly attributes specific features to EO 14275 that are not in the order or documented guidance—such as creating “National Priority Vendor” designations, mandating viewpoint‑neutrality and ideological nondiscrimination clauses in contracts, and explicitly cross‑referencing NSPM‑7 and domestic‑terrorism vetting. Those are substantial hallucinations about what this EO actually does, which disqualifies Doc A under the strict factuality and anti‑hallucination standards despite its stronger rhetorical intensity.",2025-11-30T08:00:29.705986Z
