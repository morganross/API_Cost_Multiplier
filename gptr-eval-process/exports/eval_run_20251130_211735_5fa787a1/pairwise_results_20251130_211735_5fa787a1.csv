Doc A misinterprets the primary functions of EO 14158, conflating it with broader, separately enacted or proposed Schedule F-style civil service reforms, thereby failing the critical reality check.",2025-11-30T21:13:21.282047Z

Doc A, while rhetorically strong, contains severe factual inaccuracies regarding the specific actions mandated by EO 14158, conflating it with other policies like Schedule F, which is a critical hallucination.",2025-11-30T21:13:21.330300Z
