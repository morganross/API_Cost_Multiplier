--- title: "100. EO 14246 Addressing Risks from Jenner & Block" ---

The "official" title of the EO (double‑speak)
- Executive Order 14246 — "Addressing Risks From Jenner & Block" (issued March 25, 2025; published in the Federal Register March 28, 2025). ([regulations.justia.com](https://regulations.justia.com/regulations/fedreg/2025/03/28/2025-05519.html?utm_source=openai))

Our name for the EO (descriptive, derisive, accurate)
- The "Scarlet Letter" EO — the Law‑Firm Blacklist & Gag Order.

A concise list of what the EO actually does (factual summary)
- Names Jenner & Block LLP for disfavored treatment and singles out Jenner personnel (including a named attorney) for restrictions. ([presidency.ucsb.edu](https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/executive-order-14246-addressing-risks-from-jenner-block?utm_source=openai))  
- Immediately suspends security clearances held by Jenner employees pending review. ([whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/03/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-addresses-risks-from-jenner-block/?utm_source=openai))  
- Restricts Jenner employees’ access to federal buildings and SCIFs and orders agencies to halt material/services to the firm. ([whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/03/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-addresses-risks-from-jenner-block/?utm_source=openai))  
- Directs agencies, to the extent permitted by law, to refrain from hiring Jenner employees unless a head‑of‑agency waiver is granted. ([regulations.justia.com](https://regulations.justia.com/regulations/fedreg/2025/03/28/2025-05519.html?utm_source=openai))  
- Orders review and potential termination of federal contracts involving Jenner and directs agency guidance to limit engagement with Jenner personnel. ([whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/03/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-addresses-risks-from-jenner-block/?utm_source=openai))

What it claims to do and why it claims to do it (official justification, neutral summary)
- The Administration’s public justification frames the EO as a national‑security and taxpayer‑protection measure: it alleges that certain "Big Law" firms engage in conduct that threatens public safety, national security, election integrity, and "bedrock American principles," and that pro bono and other firm activities allegedly subsidize causes the Administration deems harmful. The Fact Sheet says the order is meant to suspend access and contracts while agencies review whether continued relationships are "consistent with the national interest." ([whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/03/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-addresses-risks-from-jenner-block/?utm_source=openai))

What nefarious thing it actually does or aims to do (critical analysis supported by sources)
- Weaponizes executive powers to punish legal advocacy: On its face the EO uses security clearances, access to federal facilities, procurement leverage, and hiring restrictions as blunt instruments to penalize a private law firm for the clients it has represented and the causes it has litigated. Those are enforcement tools the executive can use as a blacklist; the EO explicitly names individuals and the firm and ties adverse enforcement outcomes to their speech and litigation choices. This is textually evident in the EO itself and in the White House fact sheet. ([regulations.justia.com](https://regulations.justia.com/regulations/fedreg/2025/03/28/2025-05519.html?utm_source=openai))
- Punishes speech and representation, not misconduct: A federal judge concluded the EO was viewpoint‑discriminatory and punitive — presenting the firm with a choice to "change its speech or suffer a serious injury to its livelihood." The court found the order "punishes and seeks to silence speech" and that it uniquely chills pro bono work and representation of unpopular clients. That judicial finding confirms the EO’s effect is to retaliate against legal views and activity, not to correct a legitimate security breach. ([caselaw.findlaw.com](https://caselaw.findlaw.com/court/us-dis-crt-dis-col/117299428.html?utm_source=openai))
- Chills access to counsel and public‑interest litigation: By threatening penalties on firms that take on civil‑rights, immigration, environmental, or trans‑health matters, the EO creates a market pressure that will make firms turn away high‑risk public‑interest clients or avoid contentious areas of law. The court highlighted the real economic leverage here (the opinion cited estimates of a large share of Jenner’s work tied to government contracts), and national reporting shows this action is part of a broader campaign that has already pressured other firms. The predictable result is fewer defenses and fewer challengers to abusive or unlawful government policy. ([jurist.org](https://www.jurist.org/news/2025/05/us-federal-court-permanently-blocks-executive-order-targeting-law-firm/?utm_source=openai))
- Centralizes coercive authority and normalizes targeting: This EO maps an authoritarian toolkit onto ordinary executive functions: use of clearance procedures, procurement rules, and hiring controls to impose political discipline on private actors. That makes executive branch discretion into a weapon for political retribution and creates a playbook to be replicated against other institutions (other firms were reportedly targeted with similar orders). ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-signs-executive-order-against-law-firm-jenner-block-2025-03-25/?utm_source=openai))

How and why the damage done by this Trump action fits into his broader nefarious plans (pattern, intent, consequences)
- This EO is not an isolated administrative tweak; it is part of a pattern of retaliatory measures that aim to immunize the executive from legal and political accountability and to delegitimize independent institutions that check power. By targeting lawyers, the Administration is intentionally weakening the adversarial system that allows plaintiffs to challenge government action — a direct attack on separation of powers and the rule of law. Multiple news and court records show the EO’s structure mirrors prior actions targeting other firms, demonstrating an escalatory plan to deter legal challenges and to centralize power by intimidating the legal ecosystem. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-signs-executive-order-against-law-firm-jenner-block-2025-03-25/?utm_source=openai))

Describe what harm this EO causes (tangible consequences)
- Immediate legal‑service harm: It threatens ongoing representation (including federal criminal defense and cases challenging government policies), meaning clients lose experienced counsel or face interruptions. Courts and reporting noted that the suspension of clearances and access can prevent representation in sensitive matters. ([jurist.org](https://www.jurist.org/news/2025/05/us-federal-court-permanently-blocks-executive-order-targeting-law-firm/?utm_source=openai))  
- Chilling of pro bono and public‑interest work: Firms will self‑censor to avoid government retaliation; amicus filings and bar‑association briefs show widespread concern in the legal community that the EO will dry up pro bono representation for marginalized clients. ([jennerfirm.com](https://www.jennerfirm.com/?utm_source=openai))  
- Economic damage and market distortion: The EO threatens contracts and revenues (the court noted a substantial portion of Jenner’s work involved government business), distorting the market for legal services and penalizing firms for lawful advocacy. ([jurist.org](https://www.jurist.org/news/2025/05/us-federal-court-permanently-blocks-executive-order-targeting-law-firm/?utm_source=openai))  
- Erosion of access to justice for vulnerable groups: Plaintiffs suing on behalf of transgender youth, asylum seekers, environmental plaintiffs, or civil‑rights claimants will face fewer experienced counsel and greater legal friction, entrenching regulatory capture and corporate impunity. Reporting connects Jenner’s litigation portfolio to exactly these types of matters that would be chilled. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-signs-executive-order-against-law-firm-jenner-block-2025-03-25/?utm_source=openai))  
- Constitutional and institutional harm: The EO attempts to insulate government policy from judicial review by removing the lawyers who would litigate challenges — an explicit assault on adversarial litigation as the principal check on executive overreach. A federal judge described the EO as an effort to "insulate the Government's laws from judicial inquiry." ([caselaw.findlaw.com](https://caselaw.findlaw.com/court/us-dis-crt-dis-col/117299428.html?utm_source=openai))

Status, enforcement, and litigation note (brief factual timeline)
- EO issued March 25, 2025; Jenner & Block sued March 28, 2025 and secured emergency relief; on May 23, 2025 a federal district court (Judge John D. Bates, D.D.C.) granted Jenner summary judgment and permanently enjoined enforcement of the operative sections of EO 14246 as unconstitutional. The government has signaled objections in filings but the order stands until reversed on appeal. ([regulations.justia.com](https://regulations.justia.com/regulations/fedreg/2025/03/28/2025-05519.html?utm_source=openai))

Three concrete actions for the next administration to undo the damage (each 1–3 lines; includes where to act)
1) Rescind the EO immediately by executive order and publish the rescission in the Federal Register; simultaneously instruct the White House Counsel and OMB to withdraw any implementing guidance issued under EO 14246 so agencies stop treating the original order as policy. (Authority: White House / Federal Register.) ([regulations.justia.com](https://regulations.justia.com/regulations/fedreg/2025/03/28/2025-05519.html?utm_source=openai))

2) Direct DOJ, OMB, OPM and relevant agency security offices to restore or promptly review and reinstate any revoked security clearances, to recall and re‑authorize any improperly terminated contracts, and to issue a formal governmentwide memo restoring ordinary procurement and hiring practices (with immediate notice to affected firms and employees). (Authorities: Attorney General; OMB; Office of Personnel Management; agency security offices.) ([caselaw.findlaw.com](https://caselaw.findlaw.com/court/us-dis-crt-dis-col/117299428.html?utm_source=openai))

3) Pursue legislative and oversight safeguards: open Congressional oversight hearings (House and Senate Judiciary) to investigate the use of procurement and clearance rules for political retaliation; draft statutory protections forbidding viewpoint‑based blacklisting of lawyers and prohibiting use of procurement/clearance processes to punish legal representation. Use the court record and the widespread amicus support documented in the Jenner litigation as basis for hearings. (Authority: Congress — House and Senate Judiciary/Appropriations oversight.) ([clearinghouse.net](https://clearinghouse.net/case/46298/?utm_source=openai))

Short concluding assessment (one paragraph)
- EO 14246 was a direct, politicized attack on the legal profession’s role as a check on power: it attempted to convert ordinary administrative levers (clearances, contracts, access, hiring) into a blacklist for lawyers whose work the Administration dislikes. The policy was legally unsound (and finally enjoined by a federal court), injurious to access to justice, and emblematic of a broader strategy to deter challenges to executive power. Repeal, administrative reversal, and legislative guardrails are necessary to restore normal legal channels and to stop the executive from weaponizing government machinery against lawyers and their clients.
