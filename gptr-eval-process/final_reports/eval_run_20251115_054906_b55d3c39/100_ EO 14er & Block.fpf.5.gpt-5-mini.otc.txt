title: "100. EO 14246 Addressing Risks from Jenner & Block"

Official title (double‑speak)
- Executive Order 14246 — “Addressing Risks From Jenner & Block.” ([presidency.ucsb.edu](https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/executive-order-14246-addressing-risks-from-jenner-block))

Our name for the EO (descriptive, derisive, accurate)
- The “Blacklist the Lawyers” EO (Targeted Retaliation / Legal Chill Order)

What the EO does (short factual list)
- Suspends — pending review — any active security clearances held by individuals at Jenner & Block. ([presidency.ucsb.edu](https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/executive-order-14246-addressing-risks-from-jenner-block))  
- Directs agencies to identify and cease providing government goods, property, material and services (including SCIF access) to Jenner and to restrict Jenner employees’ access to federal buildings. ([presidency.ucsb.edu](https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/executive-order-14246-addressing-risks-from-jenner-block))  
- Orders federal contracting agencies to identify and review contracts involving Jenner, and to, to the extent permitted by law, terminate contracts or refuse reimbursement where Jenner is involved. ([presidency.ucsb.edu](https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/executive-order-14246-addressing-risks-from-jenner-block))  
- Instructs agency heads to limit official engagement with Jenner employees and, to the extent permitted by law, refrain from hiring Jenner employees absent high‑level waivers. ([presidency.ucsb.edu](https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/executive-order-14246-addressing-risks-from-jenner-block))  
- Frames these actions as an anti‑“weaponization” and taxpayer‑protection measure in a White House fact sheet explaining the EO. ([whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/03/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-addresses-risks-from-jenner-block/))

What it claims to do and why it claims to do it (neutral summary, official sources)
- Official justification: the White House and the EO say this is a national‑interest measure to stop “Big Law” firms from “weaponiz[ing]” the legal system, engaging in partisan “lawfare,” discriminating in hiring, or otherwise using pro bono and corporate resources to advance causes allegedly hostile to American interests. The administration framed the EO as protecting national security, preventing taxpayer dollars from subsidizing such work, and defending traditional social values. ([whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/03/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-addresses-risks-from-jenner-block/))

What it actually does or aims to do (critical analysis; mechanisms and beneficiaries)
- Targeted punishment of adversarial lawyering: Although couched in “national security” language, the order singles out a single law firm (Jenner & Block) and a named attorney, and weaponizes administrative levers (security clearances, building access, contracting) to impose professional and economic sanctions on lawyers and their firm for the clients they represent and the positions they take. The EO therefore functions as selective retaliation against politically disfavored legal advocacy rather than as a neutral security measure. ([presidency.ucsb.edu](https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/executive-order-14246-addressing-risks-from-jenner-block))  
- Chilling effect on representation and pro bono work: By threatening loss of clearances, access to federal work and facilities, and government contracting relationships, the EO creates immediate financial pressure and reputational “scarlet lettering” that discourages firms and individual attorneys from taking on sensitive, high‑stakes public‑interest or adversarial work (immigration, transgender care, environmental challenges, civil‑rights litigation). News coverage and the court record document industry and bar‑association alarm about this chilling effect. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-signs-executive-order-against-law-firm-jenner-block-2025-03-25/))  
- Centralization and personalization of executive power: The EO demonstrates a pattern of converting ordinary executive prerogatives into tools for political vendetta — directing multiple agencies to execute punitive measures against private actors singled out by name. That turns routine administrative authorities (clearance processes, contracting rules, facility access) into discretionary instruments of political coercion benefiting an administration and its allies. This posture advantages political control and private interests aligned with the Administration while harming independent institutions (courts, bar, civil society). ([presidency.ucsb.edu](https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/executive-order-14246-addressing-risks-from-jenner-block))  
- Beneficiaries: short term political gain for the Administration (silencing legal opposition, rewarding allied firms), and longer‑term benefits to corporate or ideological allies who gain from weakened checks on executive policy. The practical beneficiaries are those who prefer fewer injunctive lawsuits and less adversarial litigation — typically powerful private interests and the Administration itself. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-signs-executive-order-against-law-firm-jenner-block-2025-03-25/))

How and why this EO fits into the administration’s broader strategy of power centralization and authoritarian drift
- Pattern of punitive executive actions: EO 14246 follows earlier orders and public efforts by the Administration to punish or coerce firms and officials perceived as hostile (previous orders targeting other major law firms are part of the same pattern). The EO explicitly ties itself to EO 14147 (“Ending the Weaponization of the Federal Government”), showing an administration strategy that rhetorically claims to fix “weaponization” while in practice consolidating discretionary executive power to silence critics. ([presidency.ucsb.edu](https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/executive-order-14246-addressing-risks-from-jenner-block))  
- Institutional erosion: By using administrative levers to insulate policy from judicial review (punishing firms that sue or represent litigants challenging government action), the EO weakens the separation of powers — diminishing the practical ability of private parties to force government accountability through litigation, and thereby shrinking constitutional checks. A predictable result is fewer meaningful challenges to arbitrary or unlawful government policy. ([clearinghouse.net](https://clearinghouse.net/case/46298/))  
- Chilling of professional independence: Targeting lawyers for the clients they represent undermines the independence of the bar, corrodes norms of zealous representation and access to counsel for vulnerable litigants, and converts professional duties into liabilities when those duties conflict with the Administration’s political agenda. That is exactly the mechanism needed to entrench rule by decree rather than by law. ([clearinghouse.net](https://clearinghouse.net/case/46298/))

Describe the harms caused (concrete consequences)
- Immediate legal and economic harm to Jenner & Block staff and contractors: suspension of clearances, loss of SCIF/facility access, and contract terminations threaten revenue streams and careers — and can push clients and contractors to avoid the firm. Agencies and government contractors often account for material portions of big‑law revenue; cutting that off is an existential risk for practice areas that serve government clients and pro bono litigants. ([presidency.ucsb.edu](https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/executive-order-14246-addressing-risks-from-jenner-block))  
- Reduced legal representation for vulnerable people: Jenner & Block was counsel in litigation defending transgender minors’ health‑care access, immigrant and asylum rights, and environmental enforcement actions — all matters disproportionately affecting marginalized groups. The order’s chilling effect makes it harder for plaintiffs to find experienced counsel willing to risk government retaliation. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-signs-executive-order-against-law-firm-jenner-block-2025-03-25/))  
- Assault on rule of law and separation of powers: The EO attempts to punish litigation that subjects executive policy to judicial review, thereby narrowing the space for courts to check executive overreach. The D.C. District Court found the EO ran afoul of First (and other) Amendment protections, reflecting the constitutional dangers government‑targeted orders like this pose. ([clearinghouse.net](https://clearinghouse.net/case/46298/))  
- Normative damage to professional norms and civil liberties: Normalizing punitive administrative pressure against lawyers reorients the incentives of the legal profession away from defending rights and toward risk‑averse service to power. That harms public legal infrastructure, the publicity of constitutional adjudication, and civic trust in impartial justice. ([clearinghouse.net](https://clearinghouse.net/case/46298/))

Relevant factual/legal developments (concise)
- EO signed March 25, 2025; published in the Federal Register March 28, 2025. ([presidency.ucsb.edu](https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/executive-order-14246-addressing-risks-from-jenner-block))  
- Litigation: Jenner filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia; the court preliminarily enjoined key sections and later granted permanent relief, holding the EO unconstitutional as viewpoint‑discriminatory and an unlawful attempt to punish protected speech and legal advocacy (summary judgment/permanent injunction). Appeals were filed. ([clearinghouse.net](https://clearinghouse.net/case/46298/))

Three concrete actions for the next administration to undo the damage (1–3 lines each, with links)
1) Rescind EO 14246 immediately and publish the rescission in the Federal Register; simultaneously issue a White House memo directing all agencies to treat actions taken under the EO as void and to restore contractual and building‑access relations unless an individual, case‑by‑case national security determination supported by law and evidence exists. (See Federal Register — Presidential Documents.)  
   - Federal Register (Executive Orders landing page): https://www.federalregister.gov/presidential-documents/executive-orders

2) Order an immediate review and remediation of any personnel or clearance actions tied to the EO: direct the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) and the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to reopen and, where appropriate, reinstate security clearances that were suspended or revoked solely for protected speech, client representation, or discharged pro bono work — and issue clear public guidance protecting legal representation as a protected activity. (See OPM and ODNI guidance on personnel security.)  
   - OPM security clearance & suitability resources: https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/security-clearances/  
   - ODNI: https://www.dni.gov

3) Reaffirm contracting and procurement protections: instruct OMB and the Department of Justice to withdraw any agency guidance requiring disclosure or blacklisting of private‑sector legal relationships, direct contracting officers to rescind termination actions taken under the EO, and issue DOJ/AG guidance reasserting the independence of legal representation (and prohibiting viewpoint‑based debarment or hiring bans). Use the FAR and EEOC processes to ensure fair contracting and anti‑discrimination enforcement.

Bottom line (one sentence)
- EO 14246 is not a neutral national‑security measure — it is a targeted administrative assault on adversarial lawyering that weaponizes government processes to punish and chill litigation, and it must be swept away and remedied by the next administration to restore independence of counsel, protect vulnerable litigants, and repair separation‑of‑powers norms. ([presidency.ucsb.edu](https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/executive-order-14246-addressing-risks-from-jenner-block))

If you want, I can (a) draft a short memo the party can use internally to brief congressional allies on legislative options (e.g., statutory protections for attorney independence, procurement rule fixes), or (b) prepare model language for a Presidential rescission + implementing memoranda and agency templates to effect the three remedies above.
