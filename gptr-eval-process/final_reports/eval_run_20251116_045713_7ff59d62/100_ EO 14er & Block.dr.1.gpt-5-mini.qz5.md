# Executive Summary

This report analyzes Executive Order 14246, "Addressing Risks From Jenner & Block" (signed March 25, 2025), which explicitly targeted the law firm Jenner & Block LLP. The Order directed immediate operational and personnel restrictions on the firm, required near‑term agency reporting and contract reviews, and sought to impose collateral obligations on federal contractors and grant recipients. Federal courts have found the Order to be constitutionally problematic; the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia permanently enjoined key operative sections as unconstitutional viewpoint‑based retaliation (Judge John D. Bates, May 23, 2025). This report synthesizes primary documents, judicial findings, and independent legal analysis to (1) summarize what the EO says and does, (2) evaluate its stated justifications, (3) analyze its actual effects and underlying purposes, (4) connect it to the broader policy pattern of the Administration, (5) document concrete harms, and (6) propose three concrete remedial actions for a subsequent administration.

## The "Official" Title of the EO

Executive Order 14246 — “Addressing Risks From Jenner & Block” (signed March 25, 2025; published 90 FR 13997) ([Federal Register](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/03/28/2025-05519/addressing-risks-from-jenner-and-block)).

## Our Name for the EO (descriptive, critical)

Targeted Legal Intimidation EO — "Weaponizing Access & Contracts to Chill Legal Advocacy"

---

## What the EO Does (concise, factual list)

- Declares Jenner & Block to pose “significant risks” to U.S. interests and public safety and publicly criticizes the firm's litigation, pro bono work, and prior employment decisions ([White House EO fact sheet](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/addressing-risks-from-jenner-block/)).  
- Orders immediate suspension, pending review, of any active security clearances held by Jenner employees and directs agencies to identify and cease providing government goods, property, material, services, and SCIF access to Jenner “to the extent permitted by law.” ([White House EO](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/addressing-risks-from-jenner-block/)).  
- Directs agency heads to, “to the extent permitted by law,” issue guidance limiting official access to federal buildings by Jenner employees and limiting official engagement between federal employees and Jenner personnel when such access or engagement would threaten national security or be inconsistent with U.S. interests ([Federal Register text](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/03/28/2025-05519/addressing-risks-from-jenner-and-block)).  
- Requires federal contractors to disclose business relationships with Jenner & Block and, within 30 days, requires agencies to submit to OMB an assessment of contracts with Jenner or entities that do business with Jenner and any actions taken with respect to those contracts. The EO contemplates termination/other actions “to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law.” ([White House EO; Federal Register](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/addressing-risks-from-jenner-block/)).

---

## What the EO Claims to Do and Why (official justification)

The EO presents as a national‑security and government‑integrity measure: it claims to prevent taxpayer funds from indirectly supporting activities that “undermine justice and the interests of the United States,” and to protect government facilities, classified programs, and federal contracting from perceived “risks” tied to certain law‑firm conduct. The White House framed the action as necessary to safeguard national security and public safety by limiting a firm’s access to personnel, facilities, contracts, and clearances while agencies review relationships and perceived risks ([White House EO](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/addressing-risks-from-jenner-block/)). The Federal Register publication formalized those administrative directives and cross‑referenced related EOs aimed at “weaponization” and “risks” from specified firms ([Federal Register](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/03/28/2025-05519/addressing-risks-from-jenner-and-block)).

## What the EO Actually Does or Aims to Do — Critical Analysis

Beyond its stated purpose, EO 14246 functions as an instrument of personalized administrative coercion and political retaliation with multiple institutional effects:

1. Viewpoint‑based punishment and chilling of advocacy. The Order explicitly singles out Jenner for reasons tied to the firm’s litigation, pro bono causes, and prior employment decisions concerning individuals critical of the Administration. By imposing immediate operational handicaps (clearance suspensions, access limits, contractor disclosure obligations), the EO coerced clients and contractors to disengage from Jenner — an outcome the court described as “punish[ing] and seek[ing] to silence speech” (Bates, D.D.C.) and constituting viewpoint discrimination ([Justia opinion](https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/district-of-columbia/dcdce/1:2025cv00916/278932/138/)).

2. Instrumentalizing procurement and contractor relationships to exert pressure on private-sector legal representation. The EO demanded reporting and disclosure requirements for contractors and encouraged agencies to terminate contracts involving Jenner “to the maximum extent permitted by law,” weaponizing federal procurement tools to control who firms may represent or with whom they may do business — intruding on contractor autonomy and interfering with the attorney‑client marketplace.

3. Administrative shortcutting and executive overreach. The Order attempted to effect significant operational and regulatory change via executive direction—suspending clearances and altering access and contracting practices—without the procedural safeguards of notice‑and‑comment or independent findings of harm. It followed a pattern of using executive directives and agency expedited actions (frequently invoking “good cause”) to implement sweeping policy changes, raising separation‑of‑powers and administrative‑law concerns (see analysis of expedited rulemaking practices and ACUS recommendations) ([Regulatory Review](https://www.theregreview.org/2025/06/04/squillace-public-engagement-in-expedited-agency-rulemaking/)).

4. Delegitimizing independent legal institutions. By naming a law firm and threatening collateral sanctions, EO 14246 undermined the independence of the bar and the adversary system; the court described this as an “assault on the independence of the bar” that threatened the judiciary’s ability to check executive power ([Court opinion](https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/district-of-columbia/dcdce/1:2025cv00916/278932/138/)).

Beneficiaries: politically aligned actors who favor weakening litigation and advocacy against the Administration; short‑term political goals (silencing litigation) and partisan advantage. Harmed parties: Jenner’s clients, the firm’s employees, the civil‑liberties ecosystem, government contractors, and public access to independent counsel.

## How This EO Fits Into Broader Administration Patterns

EO 14246 is part of a sequence of targeted executive actions issued in early 2025 that focused on specific law firms (Perkins Coie, WilmerHale, and Jenner & Block) and on reversing longstanding federal nondiscrimination/affirmative action frameworks (e.g., revocation of EO 11246 and subsequent DOL regulatory actions). Taken together, these measures reflect an Administration strategy with multiple components:

- Centralize executive control over access to government institutions and contracting to reward political loyalty and punish adversaries. The repeated use of individualized EOs targeting law firms shows a pattern of administrative personalization of power. Judges repeatedly found these orders to be retaliatory and viewpoint‑discriminatory (e.g., Perkins Coie, Jenner) ([Justia decision](https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/district-of-columbia/dcdce/1:2025cv00916/278932/138/)).

- Rapid regulatory rollback and procedural abridgment. The Administration sought to revoke EO 11246 and remove OFCCP protections by expedited agency actions and rescissions; the DOL cited alignment with new Executive Orders in proposing formal rescission of the EO 11246 implementing regulations ([DOL FR rescission](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/07/01/2025-12276/rescission-of-executive-order-11246-implementing-regulations)). The pattern includes aggressive use of “good cause” to avoid notice‑and‑comment (a practice criticized in ACUS Recommendation 2024‑6) ([Regulatory Review](https://www.theregreview.org/2025/06/04/squillace-public-engagement-in-expedited-agency-rulemaking/)).

- Reconfiguring administrative levers (procurement, security clearances, building access) to effect political ends. This risks institutionalizing selective enforcement and undermining neutral rule‑based administration.

Collectively, these actions erode institutional checks (independent bar, procedural safeguards, nonpartisan procurement rules) and concentrate discretionary power within the Executive Branch.

## Concrete Harms Caused by EO 14246

- Immediate operational harms to legal representation: DOJ and other agencies barred Jenner counsel from meetings and access to federal facilities—causing clients to seek replacement counsel and disrupting ongoing representation; the court record indicated at least one client had its counsel excluded and then retained new counsel before a TRO reversed the exclusion ([Court record](https://globalfreedomofexpression.columbia.edu/cases/jenner-v-us-department-of-justice/)).

- Economic damage: the D.D.C. opinion noted roughly 40% of Jenner’s revenue came from government contractors/subcontractors/affiliates, placing substantial revenue at risk and creating a “scarlet letter” effect that could deter clients and partners ([Court opinion](https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/district-of-columbia/dcdce/1:2025cv00916/278932/138/)).

- Chilling of pro bono/public‑interest litigation: restrictive, punitive treatment of firms for their pro bono causes deters litigators and nonprofits from soliciting robust legal challenges to government policy, constraining access to justice for vulnerable populations.

- Contracting and compliance uncertainty: the EO’s contracting directives and related agency guidance generated confusion and legal risk for contractors about disclosures and vendor selection, undermining the integrity and predictability of federal procurement.

- Institutional erosion: the EO’s targeting of a profession critical to the judicial check threatens separation‑of‑powers norms and the independence of the bar.

## Three Concrete Actions for the Next Administration (1–3 lines each)

1. Rescind EO 14246 and issue a binding White House memo directing all agencies to withdraw any guidance or enforcement actions taken under it; instruct OMB and agency general counsels to restore affected security clearances, access rights, and contract relationships, and to notify impacted clients and contractors of restored status. (Authority: Presidential revocation/White House action; see EO text and Federal Register entry) ([Federal Register EO](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/03/28/2025-05519/addressing-risks-from-jenner-and-block)).

2. Direct DOL/OFCCP and the relevant contracting agencies (GSA, DoD acquisition offices) to restore EO 11246 protections by initiating rulemaking to reinstate implementing regulations and related FAR clauses (or, if needed, issue agency-level temporary guidance reversing class deviations), using full notice‑and‑comment procedures to ensure durable statutory and regulatory shelter for nondiscrimination. (Authority: DOL/OFCCP; FAR & GSA rulemaking) ([DOL rescission FR context](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/07/01/2025-12276/rescission-of-executive-order-11246-implementing-regulations)).

3. Launch executive‑branch and legislative remedies to insulate the independence of counsel: (a) issue a Presidential policy memorandum forbidding agency directives that debar or sanction law firms for their litigation or advocacy activities absent individualized, litigable findings and statutory authority; (b) instruct DOJ to withdraw appeals of court injunctions that invalidated targeted EOs and to pledge non‑retaliation; (c) seek Congressional oversight hearings and, where appropriate, statutory limits on politicized use of security‑clearance and procurement tools. (Authorities: OMB, DOJ, Congress).

## Conclusion and Recommendation (Opinion)

EO 14246 represented a novel and dangerous use of executive power: it weaponized procurement, security clearances, and facility access to penalize a private law firm for its speech, advocacy, and employment choices. The District Court’s permanent injunction accurately described the EO as viewpoint‑discriminatory and as an attack on the independence of the bar; those findings underscore the constitutional, institutional, and democratic harms measurable in both immediate disruption to clients and firms and in broader chilling effects on public‑interest litigation. A future administration committed to restoring democratic norms should (1) immediately revoke and repudiate EO 14246, (2) restore regulatory protections and contracting predictability—especially EO 11246’s nondiscrimination framework—and (3) strengthen procedural and statutory safeguards that prevent personalization of administrative tools for political ends.
