1) What EO 14246 directs — a plain list
- Immediately directs the Attorney General, Director of National Intelligence (DNI), and other agency heads “to take steps consistent with applicable law to suspend any active security clearances held by individuals at Jenner & Block pending a review of whether such clearances are consistent with the national interest.” ([EO 14246 text](https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/executive-order-14246-addressing-risks-from-jenner-block))  
- Instructs agencies to identify government material/services (including SCIF access) granted to Jenner & Block and “to the extent permitted by law, expeditiously cease such provision.” ([EO 14246 text](https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/executive-order-14246-addressing-risks-from-jenner-block))  
- Orders agencies to identify and review contracts with Jenner and entities that do business with Jenner and to take agency procurement actions as appropriate. ([EO 14246 text](https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/executive-order-14246-addressing-risks-from-jenner-block))  
- Directs the EEOC and Attorney General (via earlier and related EOs) to examine whether Jenner’s DEI policies constitute unlawful discrimination (ties EO 14246 to EO 14230 on Perkins Coie). ([EO 14246 text](https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/executive-order-14246-addressing-risks-from-jenner-block))  
- States the Order must be “implemented consistent with applicable law” and subject to appropriations (boilerplate caveat). ([EO 14246 text](https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/executive-order-14246-addressing-risks-from-jenner-block))

2) What it claims to do and why it claims to do it (neutral summary)
The Order frames Jenner & Block as a firm that has “abandoned the profession’s highest ideals” and who “engage(s) in activities that undermine justice and the interests of the United States.” The Administration says the measures are necessary to protect national security, federal taxpayer funds, and the integrity of government contracting and federal employment. EO 14246 is described publicly as a narrow national‑security and procurement safeguard: temporarily suspend or limit firm access to sensitive government facilities/information and review agency relationships (clearances, contracts, hiring) to ensure they align with the national interest ([EO 14246 text](https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/executive-order-14246-addressing-risks-from-jenner-block)).

For public messaging, the White House presents the Order as protective, not punitive — a precautionary “review” intended to prevent “access to our Nation’s secrets” by actors alleged to have engaged in “weaponized” litigation or ethically suspect conduct. The formal text repeats the “consistent with applicable law” caveat that superficially limits implementation discretion ([EO 14246 text](https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/executive-order-14246-addressing-risks-from-jenner-block)).

3) What nefarious thing it actually does or aims to do — deep analysis
Although drafted as a “national security” and procurement review, EO 14246 is structurally and practically designed to exert coercive pressure on an independent law firm for the firm’s advocacy, client choices, and hiring decisions. Key analytical points:

- Mechanism of coercion through administrative levers: The Order weaponizes routine executive‑branch tools (security clearances, contracting authority, facility access, and hiring discretion) and converts them into political sanctions targeted at a private actor. By directing agency heads to suspend clearances and cease services, the EO attempts to economically and operationally disable Jenner’s ability to represent government‑connected clients, perform government‑adjacent work, and place attorneys in public‑sector roles. Those are not abstract powers — they remove essential access and revenue streams (contract work and federal litigation or representation), and they stigmatize the firm publicly. The EO therefore functions as a de facto blacklist. This is not speculation: contemporaneous litigation against similar orders (e.g., Perkins Coie and Jenner litigation) shows courts viewing the Orders as targeting firms for advocacy and as retaliatory in effect ([Perkins Coie litigation summary](https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/district-of-columbia/dcdce/1:2025cv00716/278290/185/); [Jenner opinion](https://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/jenner-block-trump-illegal-retatliation-opinion.pdf)).

- Chilling of legal representation and pro bono work: By threatening public‑sector access and contracts, the EO creates a strong chilling incentive for firms to decline controversial clients or strategic litigation. The practical consequence is that constitutional claims and civil‑rights advocacy — much of which depends on pro bono capacity and fearless representation — are likely to be curtailed. Judge John D. Bates’s opinion in Jenner noted the chilling effect and found viewpoint‑based retaliation in the EO’s language and aims ([Jenner opinion](https://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/jenner-block-trump-illegal-retatliation-opinion.pdf)).

- Circumventing procedural safeguards: Security‑clearance revocations and suspensions for individuals normally proceed under defined administrative rules, Adjudicative Guidelines, and agency processes (e.g., Executive Orders 12968/10450, DoDI 5200.02 and SEAD policies). EO 14246 attempts to short‑circuit or politicize those processes by directing mass suspensions for political reasons. Even where the EO inserts the phrase “consistent with applicable law,” it invites agencies to treat the President’s factual findings as a basis for blanket administrative actions, undermining individualized adjudication and due process protections; courts recognized that this risk raises serious First and Fifth Amendment issues in litigation ([DoDI 5200.02 context](https://govfacts.org/federal/defense/security-clearance-secrets-a-guide-to-dod-civilian-requirements/); [Jenner opinion](https://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/jenner-block-trump-illegal-retatliation-opinion.pdf)).

- Using contracting rules as a pressure point: The Administration’s instruction to “identify and cancel” contracts implicates FAR authorities (including termination for convenience), but those rules include procedures and protest rights. The Order exploits contracting complexity to inflict reputational and financial injuries even where formal termination may later be litigated (FAR termination procedures and the Government’s broad convenience termination authority create an asymmetric dynamic that favors the government as an instrument of pressure).

Beneficiaries and motivations: The primary beneficiaries of this EO are not “national security” per se but an administration seeking to (a) punish law firms and legal counsel that represent disfavored clients and causes, (b) intimidate the bar to produce self‑censorship or political compliance, and (c) consolidate power by delegitimizing independent legal oversight of executive actions. The effect disproportionately harms civil‑rights, immigration, LGBTQ, media, and other advocacy clients who depend on robust defense and representation.

4) How and why the damage fits into the broader authoritarian pattern
EO 14246 is one of several contemporaneous executive actions directed at major law firms (Perkins Coie, Paul Weiss, WilmerHale, etc.). These Orders constitute a pattern:
- Centralization of punishment in the Executive Branch: Rather than using neutral investigatory agencies or courts, the President seeks to use broad unilateral directives to impose economic and regulatory sanctions on private actors for political reasons. Repeated issuance of these EOs shows an emerging administrative tactic: convert routine administrative authorities into political levers to deter and punish opposition and critical legal advocacy ([Jackson Kelly white paper on EO targeting of law firms](https://www.jacksonkelly.com/uploads/2025-08-07-Executive-Orders-Targeting-Law-Firms-WVBA-Submission-4900-7452-3739.pdf); [Syracuse Law Review commentary](https://lawreview.syr.edu/executive-orders-aimed-at-major-law-firms-spark-industry-debate-resist-or-surrender/)).

- Erosion of institutional checks: By using opaque “national security” rationales and intermixing them with claims about DEI, “weaponized” litigation, and partisan activity, the administration undermines the independent oversight function of the judiciary and the impartiality of agencies (e.g., by directing EEOC reviews driven by political priorities). Several federal judges have already rejected or enjoined these orders on constitutional grounds — the litigation history itself is evidence that these are overbroad political acts rather than legitimate national‑security safeguards ([Jenner opinion](https://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/jenner-block-trump-illegal-retatliation-opinion.pdf); [Perkins Coie D.D.C. filings](https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/district-of-columbia/dcdce/1:2025cv00716/278290/185/)).

- Austerity through intimidation: The EO’s practical effect is to shrink civic space — reducing availability of legal services for marginalized populations and enabling the state to insulate itself from legal accountability. That is a classic autocratic play: circumvent legal constraints by neutralizing the institutions (law firms and lawyers) that enforce rights.

5) Concrete harms the EO causes
- To clients and vulnerable populations: Reduced access to counsel for immigration, civil‑rights, criminal defense, and pro bono matters — especially for federal defendants requiring attorneys with SCIF or facility access; the court noted that 40% of some firms’ business can derive from government‑connected clients and that removal of access will cause income loss and client displacement ([Jenner opinion discussion of harms](https://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/jenner-block-trump-illegal-retatliation-opinion.pdf)).  
- To rule of law and adversarial system: The Order discourages lawyers from taking difficult cases and chills zealous representation; it risks insulating the Executive from judicial review and enforcement of constitutional rights. Judge Bates described the EO as “punishing and seeking to silence speech.” ([Jenner opinion](https://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/jenner-block-trump-illegal-retatliation-opinion.pdf))  
- To due process and administrative fairness: Security‑clearance processes exist to protect sensitive information while preserving individualized rights; blanket suspension directed at a firm’s employees politicizes security decisions and weakens adjudicative safeguards (DoDI 5200.02 explains normal adjudicative processes). ([DoDI/DoD context](https://govfacts.org/federal/defense/security-clearance-secrets-a-guide-to-dod-civilian-requirements/))  
- To pluralism and market competition: The EO stigmatizes markets for legal services, enabling competitors to poach clients and lawyers and consolidating influence toward firms aligned with the administration. Public pressure and private sector reactions punish targeted firms economically (widely reported in contemporary commentary).

Table — EO actions vs. immediate effects

| EO Measure | Immediate Administrative Tool | Probable Immediate Effect |
|---|---:|---|
| Suspend security clearances for Jenner staff | DNI / agency adjudicative suspension | Loss of access to classified info; inability to represent clients in matters requiring clearance |
| Cease provision of government goods/services (SCIF access) | GSA / agency facility access rules | Denial of access to federal buildings; impeded litigation and representation |
| Identify/cancel contracts | Contracting officers / FAR termination for convenience | Revenue loss; reputational damage; potential legal protests |
| Direct EEOC investigations into DEI | EEOC investigatory authority | Forced resource diversion; chilling of DEI efforts; politicalized enforcement |

6) Three concrete actions for the next administration to undo the damage
1. Rescind EO 14246 and issue an Executive Memorandum directing agencies to promptly restore any suspended clearances and facility access unless individualized, adjudicated findings supported by evidence warrant continued limitation; require agencies to follow established adjudicative procedures in E.O. 12968 / DoDI 5200.02 and publish a timeline for restoration ([EO text, DoDI context](https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/executive-order-14246-addressing-risks-from-jenner-block); [DoDI 5200.02 summary](https://govfacts.org/federal/defense/security-clearance-secrets-a-guide-to-dod-civilian-requirements/)).  
   - Legal basis: President may rescind prior EOs; agencies must implement consistent with existing adjudicative law and due process.

2. Direct OMB/DOJ to issue interagency guidance/procedures prohibiting politically‑targeted mass suspension of security clearances or contractor de‑facto blacklists without individualized adjudication — codify safeguards in regulation and require notice+opportunity to respond before wholesale administrative suspensions; use OMB rulemaking to ensure agency compliance and provide affected entities a defined administrative review path (and commit to defending agencies that comply) ([EO rescission and DOJ/OLC/agency authorities](https://www.justice.gov/olc/opinion/security-clearance-adjudications-doj-access-review-committee)).

3. Initiate Congressional and administrative reforms to insulate contracting and security processes from political targeting: propose legislation (1) clarifying that procurement terminations tied to political viewpoints are prohibited and subject to GAO protest with expedited relief; and (2) require the DNI and DOD to publish redress mechanisms and timelines for mass suspension decisions, and mandate independent review panels in cases where whole‑firm measures are proposed (use FAR and CICA frameworks as the statutory vehicle) ([Acquisition/FAR/CICA context](https://www.acquisition.gov/browse/index/far); [CICA summary](https://govbrew.co/p/what-is-cica-competition-in-contracting-act)).

7) Conclusion — concrete takeaways
EO 14246 uses legitimate administrative levers (clearances, contracting, facility access) to effectuate what courts and civil‑liberties groups have characterized as viewpoint‑based retaliation against an independent law firm. Although nominally framed as a narrow national‑security review, the Order’s mechanics — mass suspension instructions, contract de‑listing, and facility access restrictions — create a powerful tool for political coercion that chills legal advocacy, weakens due process in security adjudications, and degrades public confidence in neutral administration of procurement and security programs. Reversal requires both immediate executive steps (rescission and restoration) and systemic reforms (rulemaking and possible legislation) to prevent recurrence.
