---

# Executive Summary

The official title of the Executive Order (EO):
- Executive Order 14246 — Addressing Risks From Jenner & Block (Mar. 25, 2025) (published 90 FR 13997) (The White House, 2025). ([Federal Register EO text](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/03/28/2025-05519/addressing-risks-from-jenner-and-block))

Our name for the EO (descriptive, derisive, accurate):
- "The Government-Punishes-Lawyers EO" (targeted politicized sanctioning of a law firm)

Purpose of this report:
- Provide an evidence‑based, sourced, and structured analysis of EO 14246, describing what the EO does, the government’s stated justifications, the practical and constitutional consequences, how it fits into wider administrative strategy, and concrete, short actions a future administration can take to undo the harms.

Key findings (summary):
- EO 14246 explicitly singles out Jenner & Block, directing cross‑agency suspension/review of security clearances, identification and cessation of government goods/services (including SCIF access), procurement disclosures and potential contract terminations, and personnel restrictions; it also directs Title VII review referrals. The EO was enjoined and subsequently permanently enjoined by the D.D.C., which found viewpoint discrimination and retaliation in violation of the First Amendment (Bates, D.D.C., May 23, 2025). ([Federal Register EO text](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/03/28/2025-05519/addressing-risks-from-jenner-and-block)) ([Bates opinion](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/USCOURTS-dcd-1_25-cv-00916/pdf/USCOURTS-dcd-1_25-cv-00916-0.pdf))

## 1. What EO 14246 does — concise list

- Directs the Attorney General, Director of National Intelligence (DNI), and relevant agency heads to "immediately take steps consistent with applicable law to suspend any active security clearances held by individuals at Jenner pending a review" (Sec. 2). ([Federal Register EO text](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/03/28/2025-05519/addressing-risks-from-jenner-and-block))

- Instructs the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to identify government goods, property, material, and services (including Sensitive Compartmented Information Facilities — SCIFs) provided for Jenner’s benefit and directs agencies to "expeditiously cease" such provision "to the extent permitted by law" (Sec. 2). ([Federal Register EO text](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/03/28/2025-05519/addressing-risks-from-jenner-and-block))

- Requires contractors to disclose business relationships with Jenner and tasks agency heads to review contracts and “take appropriate steps” to terminate contracts “to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law,” including potential mid‑contract terminations (Sec. 3). ([Ballotpedia summary of EO](https://ballotpedia.org/Executive_Order:_Addressing_Risks_from_Jenner_%26_Block_(Donald_Trump,_2025)))

- Directs agency heads to limit Jenner employees’ access to federal buildings, restrict government employees' engagement with Jenner personnel, and to refrain from hiring Jenner employees absent agency head waivers (Sec. 5). ([Federal Register EO text](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/03/28/2025-05519/addressing-risks-from-jenner-and-block))

- Calls for assessments of Jenner-related contracts and alignment of agency funding decisions with administration priorities; suggests Title VII review/referrals regarding alleged discriminatory employment practices (Secs. 3–4). ([Federal Register EO text](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/03/28/2025-05519/addressing-risks-from-jenner-and-block))

Table 1 — Quick comparison: EO commands vs. immediate administrative effects

| EO Command | Practical Mechanism Ordered | Immediate effect (administrative) |
|---|---:|---|
| Suspend security clearances pending review | AG, DNI, agency heads: suspend active clearances | Lawyers lose classified access; impairs representation in national‑security matters |
| Identify & cease gov't goods/services (incl. SCIF) | OMB + agencies: inventory & halt services | Loss of SCIF access, facility access, federal assistance |
| Contractor disclosures & contract reviews | Agencies require disclosure; review/terminate contracts | Procurement disruption; contractors pressured to sever ties |
| Limit federal building access & hiring | Agency guidance & hiring waivers | Hiring freeze for affected attorneys; limited official engagements |
| Title VII review referrals | EEOC/AG involvement | Potential investigations used as enforcement lever |

(EO text provides the authoritative commands) ([Federal Register EO text](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/03/28/2025-05519/addressing-risks-from-jenner-and-block)).

## 2. What it claims to do and why (official justification)

Official, public rationale (neutral summary):
- The Administration framed EO 14246 as a national‑security and accountability measure aimed at "addressing the significant risks associated with law firms" that allegedly engage in "partisan 'lawfare'," misuse pro bono practices, support activities the Administration asserts undermine public safety or national interests, and employ personnel whose past conduct is characterized as problematic. The White House fact sheet describes the EO as suspending clearances pending review, halting SCIF and other government‑provided services, refraining from hiring firm employees, and terminating contracts to prevent taxpayer funds from subsidizing actions “not aligned with American interests” (White House fact sheet, Mar. 25, 2025). ([White House fact sheet](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/addressing-risks-from-jenner-block/))

- The Federal Register text echoes these concerns, laying out the cross‑agency review steps, procurement/disclosure requirements, and personnel restrictions as mechanisms to protect national security and align agency funding with administration priorities. ([Federal Register EO text](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/03/28/2025-05519/addressing-risks-from-jenner-and-block))

## 3. What the EO actually does / likely underlying objectives (critical analysis)

High‑level thesis:
- EO 14246 weaponizes the executive branch’s administrative and national‑security tools to exert coercive pressure on a private law firm for reasons tied to that firm’s litigation choices, pro bono representations, and associates. Rather than neutral risk‑management, the Order functions as a punitive, viewpoint‑targeted instrument that (a) centralizes discretionary administrative power in the White House and selected agency leaders, (b) leverages procurement and clearance processes to induce private actors to modify conduct, and (c) uses national‑security language to shield politically motivated actions from ordinary administrative constraints.

Mechanisms by which the EO effectuates political coercion:
1. Clearance suspension as a blunt instrument. Security-clearance processes are complex and typically require individualized determinations; instructing immediate suspension “pending review” for all firm-affiliated individuals bypasses ordinary individualized suitability procedures and substitutes a categorical, firm‑wide penalty tied to protected speech and representation choices. This chills lawyers from representing disfavored clients or taking sensitive cases. ([Federal Register EO text](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/03/28/2025-05519/addressing-risks-from-jenner-and-block))

2. Procurement leverage and contagion economics. Requiring contractors to disclose relationships with Jenner and advising agencies to terminate contracts "to the extent permitted by law" creates a network effect: private contractors with government work are pressured to sever ties to avoid losing federal business — effectively imposing an extrajudicial blacklist across the market. The EO thus weaponizes government purchasing power to coerce private entities. ([Ballotpedia summary](https://ballotpedia.org/Executive_Order:_Addressing_Risks_from_Jenner_%26_Block_(Donald_Trump,_2025)))

3. Access and hiring restrictions to ostracize. Limiting access to federal buildings, SCIFs, and imposing hiring prohibitions isolates Jenner attorneys from government work and creates reputational harms (the “government‑inscribed scarlet letter” effect described by the district court), depressing the firm’s revenue streams and deterring clients. ([Bates opinion](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/USCOURTS-dcd-1_25-cv-00916/pdf/USCOURTS-dcd-1_25-cv-00916-0.pdf))

4. Administrative veneer for political retaliation. By framing the actions as national‑security or anti‑discrimination enforcement, the EO attempts to cloak viewpoint‑directed retaliation in ostensibly neutral policy goals. The D.C. federal court concluded otherwise: the order's stated findings and selection of targets indicate retaliation and viewpoint discrimination. ([Bates opinion](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/USCOURTS-dcd-1_25-cv-00916/pdf/USCOURTS-dcd-1_25-cv-00916-0.pdf))

Beneficiaries and likely motivations:
- Political benefit accrues to the administration by chilling advocacy against its priorities and rewarding compliant law firms (those that accept settlements and align with the Administration). Economic beneficiaries include contractors who align with the White House to avoid disruption; ideological beneficiaries are actors who favor limiting litigation that challenges administration policy. Investigative reporting and congressional letters note the broader pattern of EO actions directed at multiple firms and the political context (e.g., efforts to curtail DEI or representation of certain constituencies). ([Blumenthal & Raskin letter summarizing wave of EOs](https://democrats-judiciary.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/democrats-judiciary.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/2025-4-18-blumenthal-raskin-letter-to-cadwalader-002.pdf))

## 4. How this EO fits into a broader pattern and administration strategy

Pattern:
- EO 14246 is one of a coordinated series of EOs in early 2025 targeting law firms (e.g., EO 14230 targeting Perkins Coie; EO 14263 targeting Susman Godfrey). Taken together, these directives represent a sustained campaign to use executive authority to punish and reshape the legal sector’s incentives regarding client selection, pro bono work, DEI practices, and representation of politically sensitive clients. ([Federal Register Perkins Coie EO](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/03/11/2025-03989/addressing-risks-from-perkins-coie-llp))

Strategic goals (administration‑level):
- Centralize executive discretion: direct cross‑agency centralized reviews and compel agencies to align procurement and personnel decisions with White House priorities.
- Deter adversarial litigation and "lawfare": chill representation of clients or causes the administration deems hostile.
- Co-opt and reshape private behavior: force settlements, donations, or changes in hiring/DEI practices through the credible threat of government sanctions or loss of contracts.

Democratic institutions at risk:
- Erosion of rule‑of‑law norms: targeting lawyers for the clients they represent undermines attorney independence and the adversary system.
- Separation of powers and due process: broad, firm‑wide administrative penalties without individualized process or clear legal predicate threaten constitutional protections and administrative law norms.
- Marketplace censorship: procurement and clearance measures produce a private‑sector chilling effect that indirectly restricts civil society and access to counsel.

The D.D.C. decision and similar injunctions reflect judicial recognition of these constitutional threats; courts enjoined these EOs for viewpoint discrimination and due process concerns — a judicial check that is itself contested and now subject to appeals by the Administration. ([Bates opinion & appeal filings](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/USCOURTS-dcd-1_25-cv-00916/pdf/USCOURTS-dcd-1_25-cv-00916-0.pdf); [Clearinghouse case summary](https://clearinghouse.net/case/46298/))

## 5. Harms caused by EO 14246 (specific, concrete)

- Chilling effect on legal representation: attorneys and firms may decline controversial or indigent clients to avoid government sanctions, reducing access to counsel for marginalized groups and for civil‑rights, immigration, gender‑identity, and voting‑rights litigation.

- Economic harm to firm employees/clients: immediate revenue losses via contract terminations and client departures; downstream harms include layoffs, reputational damage, and loss of government‑sector work (Court noted 40% of Jenner revenue derived from government‑related clients in opinions characterizing economic impact). ([Bates opinion](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/USCOURTS-dcd-1_25-cv-00916/pdf/USCOURTS-dcd-1_25-cv-00916-0.pdf))

- Institutional degradation: using national‑security processes (clearance and SCIF access) as political weapons degrades trust in clearance adjudication and risks politicizing intelligence and security bureaucracy.

- Precedential risk: normalized use of procurement leverage to punish viewpoint risks cascading uses against NGOs, universities, media contractors, and others, concentrating coercive power in the executive.

- Due process and civil‑rights chilling: vague references to "supporting attacks" or "partisan lawfare," and cross‑agency investigatory directions (Title VII referrals) can be used to justify punitive investigations without clear standards.

## 6. Recommended actions for the next administration (3 concrete items)

1. Immediately rescind EO 14246 and any cluster EO instruments that single out private law firms; issue an executive memorandum restoring individualized, non‑discriminatory clearance and procurement standards and directing agencies to reverse actions taken under the EO (authority: President and OMB). ([Federal Register EO text (for reference)](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/03/28/2025-05519/addressing-risks-from-jenner-and-block))

2. Direct OMB and agency contracting officers to (a) restore contracts terminated or suspended solely due to association with Jenner (or other targeted firms), and (b) issue guidance forbidding disclosure/termination requirements that single out entities by viewpoint absent a lawful predicate; pursue corrective payments where appropriate under procurement rules (Federal Acquisition Regulation authority). ([Federal Register EO text; Ballotpedia procurement summary](https://ballotpedia.org/Executive_Order:_Addressing_Risks_from_Jenner_%26_Block_(Donald_Trump,_2025)))

3. Reform clearance and suitability processes: issue OPM/ODNI guidance affirming that security clearances will be adjudicated individually on legitimate national‑security grounds and prohibiting categorical sanctions based on an organization’s clients or viewpoints; establish an independent review/appeals path to prevent future politicized mass suspensions. (Office of Personnel Management & Office of the Director of National Intelligence authorities)

## 7. Conclusion — normative judgment and path forward

EO 14246 exemplifies a dangerous use of executive administrative tools to punish and coerce a private law firm for the content of its work and associations. Its mechanisms — clearance suspensions, procurement pressure, and access/hiring bans — bypass individualized process, weaponize government purchasing and security regimes, and chill fundamental legal representation and advocacy. Courts have recognized the constitutional defects and enjoined the order; however, the underlying administrative playbook remains available for reuse. A restoration of rule‑of‑law practices requires prompt rescission, procurement and clearance reform, and statutory or regulatory safeguards to prevent the political weaponization of administrative levers against lawyers, civil‑society entities, and other institutions central to democratic accountability.
