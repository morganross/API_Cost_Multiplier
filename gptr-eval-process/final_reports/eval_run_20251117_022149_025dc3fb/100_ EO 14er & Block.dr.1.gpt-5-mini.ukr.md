Executive Summary

This report analyzes Executive Order 14246, “Addressing Risks From Jenner & Block,” issued March 25, 2025. It compiles primary-source materials (the Federal Register publication of the EO and related agency materials), court documents and published analyses to explain (1) the EO’s text and official rationale, (2) its concrete directives, (3) judicial and expert appraisal of its legality and effects, (4) the broader political and institutional implications, and (5) recommended actions for a successor administration to unwind the EO’s harms. The District Court for the District of Columbia enjoined and permanently enjoined enforcement of EO 14246 on First Amendment grounds (May 23, 2025), and the Justice Department filed a notice of appeal (July 21, 2025). This report draws on those filings and contemporary commentary to synthesize legal, policy, and political impacts. Key primary documentation is cited throughout ([Federal Register, EO 14246](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/03/28/2025-05519/addressing-risks-from-jenner-and-block); [D.D.C. memorandum & order](https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/district-of-columbia/dcdce/1:2025cv00916/278932/138/)).

Official title of the EO (as published)
- Executive Order 14246, “Addressing Risks From Jenner & Block” (90 FR 13997) (March 25, 2025) ([Federal Register, EO 14246](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/03/28/2025-05519/addressing-risks-from-jenner-and-block)).

Our descriptive (derisive) name for the EO
- “The Law-Firm Punishment Order” — targeted government coercion against private legal advocacy and corporate law practice.

What the EO directs (concise list)

- Security-Clearance Suspensions and Review: Directs the Attorney General, DNI, and agency heads to “take steps consistent with applicable law to suspend any active security clearances held by individuals at Jenner pending a national-interest review” (Sec. 2) ([Federal Register, EO 14246](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/03/28/2025-05519/addressing-risks-from-jenner-and-block)).

- Contracting and Funding Reviews: Requires agencies to identify and report contracts with Jenner or entities doing business with Jenner, to require contractors to disclose business relationships with Jenner, and to “take appropriate steps to terminate any contract… to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law” (Sec. 3) ([Federal Register, EO 14246](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/03/28/2025-05519/addressing-risks-from-jenner-and-block)).

- Agency Access and Personnel Restrictions: Directs agencies to limit official access to federal facilities by Jenner employees, to limit official engagement with Jenner personnel, and to refrain from hiring Jenner employees absent waivers (Sec. 5) ([Federal Register, EO 14246](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/03/28/2025-05519/addressing-risks-from-jenner-and-block)).

- Identification and Cessation of Government Support: OMB must identify Government goods/property/services provided for Jenner and agencies must, “to the extent permitted by law,” cease provision of such goods/services (Sec. 2(b)) ([Federal Register, EO 14246](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/03/28/2025-05519/addressing-risks-from-jenner-and-block)).

- Cross-reference to Other EOs: The order references and builds on prior administration orders addressing other law firms (e.g., EO 14230 re: Perkins Coie) and directs agencies to align funding and personnel actions with Administration priorities (Secs. 1, 4).

What the EO claims to do and why (official justification)

- Stated purpose: The EO frames Jenner & Block as posing risks to “national security, public safety, elections, constitutional freedoms, or other core interests” through firm conduct—alleged partisan litigation, pro bono activities, and employment of certain individuals—thus justifying extraordinary administrative measures to prevent taxpayer-subsidized support for purportedly harmful activities ([Federal Register, EO 14246](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/03/28/2025-05519/addressing-risks-from-jenner-and-block)).

- Public justification language: The Background section asserts that some “Big Law” firms “abandon the profession’s highest ideals,” “engage in conduct detrimental to critical American interests,” and use pro bono and hired representation to “harm” national interests; the EO is presented as a protective, preventative measure to stop public resources from supporting such conduct ([Federal Register, EO 14246](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/03/28/2025-05519/addressing-risks-from-jenner-and-block)).

What it actually does or aims to do (critical analysis)

- Targeted punitive leverage over a private law firm for viewpoint and representation choices: Although framed as a national-security and contracting integrity measure, EO 14246 selectively targets one named law firm and directs a range of punitive administrative actions—suspending clearances, chilling hiring, disrupting contractual relationships, and restricting access to federal properties—that operate as tools of retaliation against the firm’s legal advocacy and its past or present people (e.g., a former partner) rather than neutral, content‑agnostic national-security procedures.

- Mechanisms of coercion and chilling effect:
  - Leveraging the federal purse: By ordering contract reviews, contractor disclosures, and potential termination, the EO uses federal procurement power to pressure private entities that interact with Jenner and thereby discourages third‑party business with the firm—an extrajudicial economic sanction that goes beyond ordinary procurement management (see Brookings analysis on the federal purse as leverage) ([Brookings Institution explainer](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/an-executive-order-explainer-why-the-courts-will-have-the-final-say-on-trumps-anti-dei-actions/)).
  - Security-clearance suspensions as professional handicap: Suspending clearances jeopardizes the ability of Jenner attorneys to represent clients in classified matters, serve in roles requiring access, or even engage in certain federal-facing practices—functionally degrading the firm’s market and professional capacities.
  - Personnel and hiring restrictions as blacklist mechanics: Directives to limit agency hiring or require agency head waivers create de facto blacklist mechanisms that deter employment or partnership, chilling movement between private practice and government service.
  - Administrative secrecy and bypass of adjudicative process: The EO instructs administrative actors to act “to the extent permitted by law,” a phrase that permits aggressive application of discretionary administrative tools while insulating the Executive from direct statutory amendment or congressional oversight.

- Beneficiaries: The measures benefit actors aligned with the Administration’s political priorities—firms and contractors that avoid contentious representation or align with Administration policy—while penalizing law firms that litigate or advocate against the Administration. The EO therefore functions as an instrument to punish dissent and reward doctrinally aligned private actors.

Judicial reaction and legal appraisal

- District Court ruling (D.D.C.): On May 23, 2025, Judge John D. Bates granted Jenner’s motion for summary judgment, declared EO 14246 unlawful as unconstitutional under the First Amendment (viewpoint discrimination/retaliation against legal advocacy), voided the EO, and entered a permanent injunction against enforcement (Order & Memorandum Opinion) ([Justia D.D.C. Memorandum & Order](https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/district-of-columbia/dcdce/1:2025cv00916/278932/138/); [Cases.justia PDF of order](https://cases.justia.com/federal/district-courts/district-of-columbia/dcdce/1:2025cv00916/278932/139/0.pdf)).

- Appeals: The Department of Justice filed a notice of appeal to the D.C. Circuit on July 21, 2025, signaling the Administration’s intent to defend the order and contest the district court’s constitutional analysis (see Law360 coverage; D.C. Circuit docket) ([Law360: DOJ to Appeal](https://www.law360.com/articles/2367338); [CourtListener appeal docket](https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/70882577/jenner-block-llp-v-doj/)).

How and why this EO fits into broader administration strategy

- Pattern of targeted EOs: EO 14246 forms part of a series of executive actions aimed at law firms, DEI programs, federal contractors, and other institutions perceived as adversarial; collectively these directives demonstrate an Administration strategy of using administrative instruments to punish institutional dissent and reshape the relationship between government power and private-sector behavior.

- Centralizing executive leverage: The EO exemplifies reliance on executive administrative authority (procurement, clearances, agency guidance) to produce policy outcomes without legislative change. The pattern concentrates power within the Executive Branch and uses routine administrative levers as instruments of political enforcement—weakening normal checks, fostering uncertainty among regulated parties, and increasing the Executive’s ability to reward/punish private actors.

- Chilling civic and professional functions: The targeted erosion of law‑firm independence interferes with adversarial legal processes, threatens the independence of counsel in matters involving government, and undermines public interest legal representation (pro bono), thereby weakening institutions essential to democratic accountability.

Concrete harms produced or threatened by the EO

- Direct harms to Jenner & Block employees and clients:
  - Loss or suspension of security clearances (preventing work on classified matters), restriction from federal buildings, and inability to take federal or contractor positions absent waivers; courts observed these as irreparable professional harms (D.D.C. opinion) ([Justia D.D.C. Memorandum & Order](https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/district-of-columbia/dcdce/1:2025cv00916/278932/138/)).

- Chilling of pro bono and public-interest law:
  - The EO targets pro bono activities as part of its justificatory narrative; threatening contractual or financial repercussions for client representations deters law firms from representing marginalized clients or controversial causes—reducing access to counsel for vulnerable populations.

- Contracting/market distortions:
  - Government-directed disclosures and contract termination actions create reputational risk for entities that continue business with targeted firms, reducing competition and concentrating federal contract opportunities among politically aligned contractors.

- Institutional erosion:
  - The EO’s use of administrative tools to penalize viewpoint undermines the separation of powers and the legal profession’s role as a check on executive authority; the resulting institution-level chilling impairs courts’ and civil-society organizations’ ability to hold government accountable.

(Compiled from EO text and court analysis) ([Federal Register EO 14246](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/03/28/2025-05519/addressing-risks-from-jenner-and-block); [D.D.C. mem. op.](https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/district-of-columbia/dcdce/1:2025cv00916/278932/138/)).

Three concrete actions for the next administration to undo the damage

1. Rescind EO 14246 and issue a directive restoring standard, content-neutral clearance and contracting procedures; coordinate OMB/DOJ/OPM to reverse any agency actions taken under the EO and restore personnel and contracting statuses where law permits (Authority: Presidential rescission and OMB/OPM guidance) — see Federal Register EO rescission process and OMB chief authority ([Federal Register, EO 14246](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/03/28/2025-05519/addressing-risks-from-jenner-and-block)).

2. Direct DOJ Civil Rights Division and the Office of the Attorney General to publicly re-affirm that legal representation and pro bono work are protected under the First Amendment and to withdraw agency guidance or enforcement steps grounded solely in viewpoints of legal advocacy; issue DOJ guidance restoring prior LEP/Title VI materials only after lawful rulemaking or proper statutory analysis (Authority: DOJ Civil Rights Division; implementation memos) — see DOJ FCS portal where guidance rescissions/updates were managed ([DOJ FCS site](https://www.justice.gov/crt/federal-coordination-and-compliance-section)).

3. Initiate a transparency and remedial audit via the Office of Inspector General (DOJ/OMB/Others as appropriate) to identify all adverse actions taken against Jenner & Block and related third parties under EO 14246, require restoration where legally permissible, and publish a remediation plan for any unlawfully imposed blacklists, hiring bans, contract terminations, or clearance suspensions (Authority: Inspectors General statutory oversight; OMB procurement oversight).

Conclusion and opinion

EO 14246 employed administrative levers—security-clearance processes, procurement power, and personnel access controls—to single out and punish a particular law firm for its legal advocacy and associations. The District Court correctly recognized and enjoined the EO as viewpoint‑targeted government retaliation in violation of the First Amendment; the EO’s practical mechanics confirm it was less a neutral national-security measure than an instrument of political coercion. Restoring rule-of-law norms requires prompt rescission, careful remediation of harms, and systemic safeguards so future administrations cannot repurpose routine administrative authorities to punish lawful, constitutionally protected advocacy.
