# Executive Summary

Official title (double‑speak): Executive Order 14246 — "Addressing Risks From Jenner & Block" (framed as protecting national security and taxpayer resources).

Our name for the EO (derisive, descriptive, and accurate): "Targeted Law‑Firm Purge EO — Weaponizing Federal Purchasing and Clearance Tools Against Political Opponents."

This report analyzes Executive Order 14246 (signed March 25, 2025), summarizes what the Order formally requires and claims to achieve, and assesses the actual effects and likely motivations of the Order. It places EO 14246 in the broader context of an administration pattern of using executive directives to single out private actors, documents tangible harms, and offers three concrete actions for a succeeding administration to undo the damage.

Key finding (brief): EO 14246 purports to protect "national interests" by suspending Jenner & Block employees' security clearances pending review, halting government provision of goods/services (including SCIF access), restricting hiring and access, and directing agencies to identify and, to the extent lawful, terminate contracts involving Jenner. In practice, the Order weaponizes procurement and personnel processes to punish and economically isolate a specific law firm the administration views as an adversary — undermining neutral federal contracting and civil‑service norms, chilling legal representation and pro bono work, and centralizing discretionary power in the White House and agency executives without clear statutory foundation ([Federal Register; White House fact sheet](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2025-03-28/pdf/2025-05519.pdf); [https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/addressing-risks-from-jenner-block/](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/addressing-risks-from-jenner-block/)).

## The EO: What it Does (Concrete, Factual List)

- Directs the Attorney General, Director of National Intelligence, and other agency heads to "immediately take steps consistent with applicable law to suspend any active security clearances held by individuals at Jenner pending a review" (security‑clearance suspension for review, not an immediate revocation) ([White House EO text](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/addressing-risks-from-jenner-block/)).

- Directs the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to identify all Government goods, property, material, and services provided for the benefit of Jenner — explicitly listing Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility (SCIF) access — and instructs agency heads to "to the extent permitted by law, expeditiously cease such provision" ([Federal Register / EO 14246, Sec. 2(b)](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2025-03-28/pdf/2025-05519.pdf)).

- Orders contracting agencies, "to the extent permissible by law," to require government contractors to disclose business relationships with Jenner and whether that work relates to the subject of the government contract; directs agency heads to review contracts with Jenner or entities that disclose dealings with Jenner and, to the extent permitted, terminate such contracts and align funding decisions with Administration priorities ([Federal Register, Sec. 3(a)-(b)](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2025-03-28/pdf/2025-05519.pdf)).

- Directs agency heads to produce guidance limiting official access from federal buildings to Jenner employees and limiting government employees acting in their official capacity from engaging with Jenner employees (explicitly naming Andrew Weissmann as an example), and to refrain from hiring Jenner employees absent a waiver after consultation with OPM ([White House EO text; Federal Register, Sec. 5](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/addressing-risks-from-jenner-block/)).

- Requires agencies to submit to OMB, within 30 days, an assessment of contracts with Jenner or entities that do business with Jenner and any actions taken under the EO ([Federal Register, Sec. 3 & Sec. 6](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2025-03-28/pdf/2025-05519.pdf)).

- Includes general provisions stating implementation "consistent with applicable law" and that the EO "is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit ... enforceable at law" (i.e., framed as discretionary and legally conditional) ([Federal Register, Sec. 6](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2025-03-28/pdf/2025-05519.pdf)).

## What the EO Claims to Do and Why (Official Rationale)

Officially, EO 14246 frames Jenner & Block as a representative of "Big Law" firms that — according to the Order — have engaged in practices that "threaten public safety and national security, limit constitutional freedoms, degrade the quality of American elections, or undermine bedrock American principles." The White House fact sheet emphasizes protecting "the national interest," preventing taxpayer funds from subsidizing activity “not aligned with American interests,” and ensuring security of classified systems by reviewing clearances and ceasing government services where necessary ([White House fact sheet; Federal Register background section](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/addressing-risks-from-jenner-block/); [https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2025-03-28/pdf/2025-05519.pdf](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2025-03-28/pdf/2025-05519.pdf)).

In short: the public justification is national‑security protection, stewardship of taxpayer funds, and preventing discriminatory practices the administration claims are tied to the firm's activities.

## What the EO Actually Does or Aims to Do (Critical Analysis)

While wrapped in "national‑security" and "taxpayer protection" language, EO 14246 functions operationally as a tool to punish and economically isolate a named private firm. The mechanisms and likely consequences include:

1. Political targeting via administrative levers. The Order explicitly names Jenner & Block (a private law firm) and singles out an individual (Andrew Weissmann). That departure from longstanding executive norms — where the government refrains from naming private parties in nationwide executive directives — raises grave due‑process and anti‑retaliation concerns. Public commentary from legal‑industry observers flagged this as "novel" and legally risky, characterizing the measures as unprecedented and likely to spur litigation and ethical conflicts for government lawyers and contractors ([Law360 analysis](https://www.law360.com/articles/2318239/law-firm-executive-orders-create-a-legal-ethics-minefield)).

2. Procurement coercion and chilling effects on representation and government contracting. By requiring contractors to disclose business with Jenner and pressuring agency heads to terminate contracts "to the extent permitted by law," the EO converts procurement processes into instruments of political enforcement. That pressure incentivizes contractors to sever ordinary legal relationships to avoid losing government work; it simultaneously chills firms' willingness to provide robust legal advocacy or pro bono services that touch on politically sensitive subjects. The Department of Justice's Procurement Integrity framework demonstrates strong statutory protections around source‑selection information and rules governing procurement disclosures; EO‑driven disclosure and termination demands intersect awkwardly with those protections and could encourage overbroad agency compliance or unlawful contract suspensions if agencies misapply discretion under political pressure ([DOJ Procurement Integrity guidance](https://www.justice.gov/jmd/procurement-integrity)).

3. Centralization of discretionary power without statutory authorization. The EO repeatedly instructs agencies to act "to the extent permitted by law" — language that both invites aggressive interpretation by sympathetic agency leaders and signals awareness that many of the actions lack clear statutory footing. The order’s approach — using OMB and agency evaluation and termination powers — leverages administrative discretion to accomplish what Congress has not authorized. This pattern resurrects classic separation‑of‑powers concerns: using executive administrative tools to effect policy and punitive outcomes without clear congressional authorization.

4. Damage to norms protecting legal advocacy and the lawyers who perform it. Naming a law firm as a national security threat for its legal work and pro bono activities risks undermining the adversary system: lawyers doing constitutionally protected advocacy could be deprived of government access, employment opportunities, or contract relationships for reasons that are political rather than based on professional misconduct.

This analysis draws on the EO text, contemporaneous legal press commentary, and an understanding of procurement and clearance regimes ([Federal Register; Law360; DOJ procurement guidance](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2025-03-28/pdf/2025-05519.pdf); [https://www.law360.com/articles/2318239/law-firm-executive-orders-create-a-legal-ethics-minefield](https://www.law360.com/articles/2318239/law-firm-executive-orders-create-a-legal-ethics-minefield); [https://www.justice.gov/jmd/procurement-integrity](https://www.justice.gov/jmd/procurement-integrity)).

## How This EO Fits Into a Broader Pattern of Centralization and Authoritarian Risk

EO 14246 is structurally similar to other administration directives that single out organizations or firms (e.g., EOs addressing Perkins Coie, Paul Weiss, others) — a coordinated strategy of using administrative authority to punish perceived opponents and reorder federal relationships (contracting, hiring, and access) in line with political priorities. This pattern advances several linked objectives:

- Concentrating control in executive offices (White House and compliant agency heads) to shape who receives federal resources and access.
- Deterring legal and civic actors from adversarial positions through economic and administrative penalties.
- Normalizing the use of non‑criminal administrative levers (contracts, clearances, building access) as political tools.

Left unchecked, these practices erode the impartial enforcement of procurement and clearance laws, weaken independence of federal career officials, and create a durable infrastructure for partisan retaliation — hallmarks of democratic backsliding and institutional weakening.

## Harms Caused by EO 14246 (Specifics)

- Immediate risk to Jenner & Block: contract terminations, loss of fees, reputational harm, and restricted access to classified facilities, even where no national‑security wrongdoing has been identified.

- Collateral damage to clients and public interest work: clients (including governments, non‑profits, and individuals) that rely on Jenner for legal representation risk losing continuity of counsel and expertise; important pro bono programs and advocacy may be curtailed.

- Chilling effect on the legal profession: law firms may decline controversial but constitutionally supported representation to avoid being targeted; former government lawyers may face career barriers due to hiring restrictions or reputational risk.

- Distortion of procurement and contracting markets: contractors will likely be pressured to disclose private legal engagements, potentially violating confidentiality or raising complex legal conflicts; small contractors may be forced into untenable decisions to preserve government revenue.

- Rule‑of‑law and constitutional risks: suspension of clearances and access without transparent process risks procedural‑due‑process violations and politicizes national‑security vetting.

Where available, federal spending and procurement data (e.g., USAspending site and agency accounting) will be necessary to quantify contract impacts; EO 14246 itself directs OMB to generate agency contract assessments — demonstrating administrative recognition that the EO directly affects government financial relationships ([USAspending data download guidance](https://www.usaspending.gov/data/about-the-data-download.pdf); [Federal Register EO text](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2025-03-28/pdf/2025-05519.pdf)).

## Table: Claimed Purpose vs. Practical Effect (Condensed)

| Claimed Purpose (Official) | Practical / Likely Effect |
|---|---|
| Protect national security by reviewing clearances | Politicized clearance suspensions; due‑process risk; career harm |
| Prevent taxpayer funds from subsidizing harmful activities | Coercive pressure on contractors; termination of lawful contracts |
| Limit access of "risky" private actors to federal facilities | Targeted exclusion of a named firm; chilling of legal advocacy |
| Ensure agencies align funding with Administration priorities | Centralized discretionary control; erosion of contracting neutrality |

## Litigation and Contested Implementation

Jenner & Block filed litigation challenging aspects of the Order and agencies' implementation; litigation activity confirms predictable legal vulnerability of the policy and the firm's view that the EO violates statutory and constitutional limits (dockets and filings are publicly available) (see Jenner & Block litigation docket). Early procedural rulings and appeals illustrate the contested legal landscape and the likelihood of protracted judicial review (see public dockets for Jenner & Block v. DOJ and related appeals).

## Recommended Actions for the Next Administration (Three Concrete Steps)

1. Rescind EO 14246 immediately by Presidential action and issue a White House memo directing agencies to cease implementation and restore any terminated contracts, access, or hiring processes absent individualized, legally supported findings — implement rescission using the White House Presidential Actions channel and publish in the Federal Register to provide legal clarity (authority: Presidential rescission & Federal Register publication). ([EO text / Federal Register](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2025-03-28/pdf/2025-05519.pdf)).

2. Direct OMB and agency Inspectors General to audit all contract terminations, disclosures, and clearance decisions made under EO 14246; where agencies overstepped legal authority, require remediation and contractual reinstatement or indemnification to affected third parties; simultaneously instruct DOJ to review any clearance suspensions for compliance with due‑process norms and relevant statutes (authorities: OMB oversight, agency IG statutes, DOJ review mechanisms). (See OMB memoranda practices and standard oversight authorities).

3. Propose, and urge Congress to pass, a statute or amendment to appropriations riders forbidding the Executive from issuing directives that name private entities for adverse administrative treatment absent a judicial or statutory finding; require minimum due‑process standards for blanket clearance suspensions and tie contract‑termination authority to existing FAR/contract law standards — to restore statutory limits on executive use of procurement and clearance tools (Congressional oversight and legislative remedy). (Relevant references: Federal Acquisition Regulation and DOJ Procurement Integrity rules).

## Conclusion and Policy Opinion

EO 14246 departs from neutral administration of procurement and security processes by directly naming a private law firm and using broad administrative levers to effect political ends. While framed as a national‑security and taxpayer‑protection measure, the Order's structure, explicit naming of private actors, and reliance on discretionary termination/withholding measures strongly indicate a political, punitive design that risks significant harms to legal representation, contract integrity, and democratic norms. A responsible, rights‑respecting successor administration should rescind the Order, audit and remediate agency actions taken under it, and pursue statutory protections to prevent a recurrence.
