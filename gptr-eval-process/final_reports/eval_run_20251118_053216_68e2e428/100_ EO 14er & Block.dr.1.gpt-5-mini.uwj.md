# Executive Summary

This report analyzes Executive Order 14246, "Addressing Risks from Jenner & Block" (Mar. 25, 2025), placing the order in legal, institutional, and political context; assessing its stated purposes and its real-world effects; and recommending concrete, immediate steps a future administration can take to reverse the damage. The assessment draws primarily on the published Executive Order and Federal Register notice, the Jenner & Block litigation record (D.D.C. Memorandum Opinion and Order), official White House materials, and contemporaneous legal reporting and analysis. ([The White House, 2025](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/addressing-risks-from-jenner-block/); [Federal Register, 2025](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/03/28/2025-05519/addressing-risks-from-jenner-and-block); [Bates, J., D.D.C., 2025](https://cases.justia.com/federal/district-courts/district-of-columbia/dcdce/1:2025cv00916/278932/138/)).

## What the EO does — operative directives (concise list)

- Directs the Attorney General, Director of National Intelligence, and "relevant heads" of executive departments/agencies to suspend any active security clearances held by Jenner & Block personnel pending national-interest review. ([White House, 2025](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/addressing-risks-from-jenner-block/))

- Orders the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to identify government goods, property, material, and services (including Sensitive Compartmented Information Facilities) provided for Jenner's benefit and directs agencies to cease such provisions "to the extent permitted by law." ([Federal Register, 2025](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/03/28/2025-05519/addressing-risks-from-jenner-and-block))

- Requires government contracting agencies (to the extent permitted by law) to compel contractors to disclose business relationships with Jenner and review and, where permissible, terminate contracts in which Jenner is involved. ([White House, 2025](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/addressing-risks-from-jenner-block/))

- Directs the EEOC to review Jenner's employment practices for alleged racial discrimination (cross‑referencing prior firm‑targeting EOs). ([Federal Register, 2025](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/03/28/2025-05519/addressing-risks-from-jenner-and-block))

- Instructs agency heads to provide guidance limiting Jenner employees’ access to federal buildings, limiting official engagement with Jenner personnel, and to refrain from hiring Jenner employees absent a high-level waiver. ([White House, 2025](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/addressing-risks-from-jenner-block/))

# What it claims to do and why it claims to do it

The Order frames itself as a public‑interest and national‑security measure. Its preamble alleges that "many major law firms take actions that threaten public safety and national security" and singles out Jenner for (in the administration's words) partisan case selection, pro bono representations the President opposes, and association with a former prosecutor whose past government work the President deems objectionable. The Order purports to (1) protect national security by reviewing clearances and access to secure facilities, (2) prevent taxpayer funds from subsidizing activities the administration views as contrary to U.S. interests by curbing contracting relationships, and (3) address alleged discriminatory employment practices through EEOC review. The White House Fact Sheet and the Federal Register publication present these measures as targeted, law‑consistent steps to protect national interests and taxpayer funds. ([White House, 2025](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/addressing-risks-from-jenner-block/); [Federal Register, 2025](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/03/28/2025-05519/addressing-risks-from-jenner-and-block))

# What nefarious thing it actually does or aims to do

Beyond its stated aims, EO 14246 functions as a politically personalized instrument that weaponizes executive authorities to punish protected legal advocacy and chill representation of disfavored clients. Close analysis of the Order and the D.D.C. opinion shows that the EO:

- Implements a blunt, firm‑wide collective punishment (suspending clearances, curtailing access to facilities, coercing contract terminations and de‑barment from federal hiring) rather than individualized, evidence‑based actions against specific people or conduct. The order applies to all Jenner employees—lawyers and non‑lawyers alike—without individualized findings of wrongdoing. The D.D.C. court found this aspect to be central to the First Amendment injury. ([Justia, D.D.C. Mem. Op., Bates, 2025](https://cases.justia.com/federal/district-courts/district-of-columbia/dcdce/1:2025cv00916/278932/138/))

- Coerces third parties (government contractors) into cutting business ties with Jenner to avoid losing federal funding; this is a form of secondary‑association penalty that chills both commercial and political association and threatens the firm's revenue (≈40% of Jenner’s revenue derives from government‑related clients, per the record). The EO effectively uses procurement leverage as a political cudgel. ([Justia, Mem. Op., 2025](https://cases.justia.com/federal/district-courts/district-of-columbia/dcdce/1:2025cv00916/278932/138/))

- Employs administrative apparatus (EEOC referral, OMB/agency guidance) to give institutional cover to punitive public shaming and economic harm while couching the measures in ostensibly lawful terms. The paper trail shows White House direction and agency implementation guidance that threatened immediate operational consequences—DOJ staff told a Jenner client Jenner could not attend a DOJ meeting—demonstrating that the EO’s effects were immediate and not merely aspirational. ([Global Freedom of Expression, Columbia; Justia, 2025](https://globalfreedomofexpression.columbia.edu/cases/jenner-v-us-department-of-justice/))

- Normalizes viewpoint discrimination: the Order’s explicit references to the firm's clients, causes, and a former employee’s prior government work show the EO is retaliatory toward protected speech and protected petitioning (representation in court), not a neutral national‑security or contracting integrity measure. The district court concluded that this targeted retaliation violated the First Amendment. ([Justia, Mem. Op., Bates, 2025](https://cases.justia.com/federal/district-courts/district-of-columbia/dcdce/1:2025cv00916/278932/138/))

Table 1: Stated Purpose vs. Practical Mechanism

| Stated purpose (official) | Practical mechanism (effect) |
|---|---|
| Protect national security by reviewing clearances | Suspends clearances firm‑wide without individualized evidence; restricts access to federal facilities |
| Prevent taxpayer support of “undesirable” activities | Forces contractors to disclose and potentially sever relations with Jenner; threatens revenue |
| Address discriminatory employment practices | Directs EEOC review selectively at one firm with political reasons stated in preamble |

# How and why the damage fits into a broader pattern

EO 14246 is one node in a broader, coordinated pattern of orders issued in rapid succession that singled out multiple major law firms (e.g., Perkins Coie, Paul Weiss, WilmerHale) for punitive administrative action tied to their litigation choices, pro bono activities, or staffing decisions. Taken together these orders constitute a strategy that:

- Centralizes discretionary power in the White House and agency heads to sanction private actors for political reasons, bypassing individualized adjudication or criminal/professional discipline processes.

- Encourages private settlement or capitulation (several firms negotiated large pro bono pledges to avoid enforcement), thereby converting personalized executive coercion into private transfers and self-censorship.

- Seeks to shrink the political space for adversarial legal advocacy (particularly on immigration, gender, and other contested issues) by making representation costly—financially, reputationally, and in terms of access—thus insulating the executive from meaningful judicial challenge.

This pattern represents a playbook: weaponize procurement, personnel, and regulatory levers to punish viewpoint and to create chilling precedents; normalize retaliatory administrative sanctions; and incentivize other private actors to disassociate from targeted actors to preserve government business. The district courts' repeated injunctions (and the ongoing appeals) confirm both the constitutional vulnerability of this playbook and the administration's willingness to press its advantage until checked by the judiciary. (Justia, D.D.C.; Perkins Coie and related litigation coverage) ([Justia, 2025](https://cases.justia.com/federal/district-courts/district-of-columbia/dcdce/1:2025cv00916/278932/138/))

# Specific harms caused by EO 14246

- Economic harm to Jenner: immediate loss or threatened loss of government‑related revenues (≈40% exposure), contract cancellations or renegotiations, and reduced ability to serve government‑contractor clients. ([Justia, 2025](https://cases.justia.com/federal/district-courts/district-of-columbia/dcdce/1:2025cv00916/278932/138/))

- Client harm: Clients were deterred or interrupted—for example, DOJ told a Jenner client its Jenner counsel could not attend a scheduled DOJ meeting, forcing clients to secure substitute counsel even before a TRO issued. This undermines client rights and continuity of representation. ([Columbia Global Freedom of Expression; Justia, 2025](https://globalfreedomofexpression.columbia.edu/cases/jenner-v-us-department-of-justice/))

- Chilling effect on legal advocacy: Law firms and individual lawyers may avoid controversial but constitutionally protected cases for fear of administrative retaliation, weakening adversarial checks on executive power and reducing access to counsel for marginalized groups (immigrants, transgender people, etc.).

- Institutional erosion: The EO encourages the use of procurement and personnel systems as political enforcement tools—blurring the line between lawful government oversight and unconstitutional viewpoint discrimination—thus degrading norms of impartial administration.

- Precedent risks: If left unchecked, this model can be replicated against other professional classes (academics, journalists, NGOs) and used to weaponize administrative authorities to silence dissent.

# Recommendations: Three concrete actions for the next administration to undo the damage

1. Immediately revoke EO 14246 by presidential revocation and direct OMB/OPM/agency heads to rescind any implementing or informal guidance and to restore status quo ante where lawful (security clearances, facility access, contracting practices). Authority: Presidential revocation of prior executive orders; OMB/OPM guidance channels. ([White House — Presidential Actions](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/); [Office of Personnel Management](https://www.opm.gov/))

2. Issue an OMB and Justice Department interagency memorandum (and, where necessary, agency-specific regulations) reaffirming procurement non‑discrimination rules and prohibiting use of procurement/contracting as a tool of viewpoint discrimination—tie procurement standards to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) anti‑discrimination and responsibility rules, and require individualized, evidence‑based determinations for suspensions/terminations. Authority: FAR and OMB procurement policy. ([Acquisition.gov — FAR](https://www.acquisition.gov/))

3. Commission and fund a legislative/regulatory package to protect client access to counsel and bar politically motivated personnel blacklisting—this should include statutory reaffirmation of the right to counsel without administrative interference, protections for law firms serving marginalized clients, and clearer judicial review mechanisms for security‑clearance suspensions that are not grounded in individualized national‑security findings. Coordinate with Congress (Authorizing Committees, Judiciary), DOJ, and OPM to draft enforceable standards. (See DOJ and congressional oversight roles). ([U.S. Department of Justice](https://www.justice.gov/); Congress — Judiciary Committees)

# Conclusion and Opinion

EO 14246 was not a neutral security or procurement measure: it was a political instrument designed to punish a law firm for viewpoints and clients disfavored by the administration. The D.D.C. court correctly found that the Order’s function was retaliatory and a violation of the First Amendment, and it enjoined key operative provisions. Repeal, remediation, and institutional safeguards are essential to prevent normalization of administrative blacklisting and to protect the independence of legal advocacy—a cornerstone of democratic check and balance. A future administration should act promptly, using revocation, agency directives, procurement reform, and—where required—legislation to restore protections, remedy harms, and insulate administrative processes from political retribution.
