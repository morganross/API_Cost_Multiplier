# Executive Summary

Official title: Executive Order 14246 — Addressing Risks From Jenner & Block (signed March 25, 2025).

Our name for the EO: The "Target‑the‑Bar EO" (a politicized executive assault on independent lawyering).

This report analyzes EO 14246, summarizes what it says it will do, explains what it actually does in practice, situates the Order in the broader pattern of the Trump administration’s institutional assaults, documents the harms, and proposes concrete steps for the next administration to reverse and repair the damage. Analysis draws on statutory text and authoritative administrative publication, the district court opinion permanently enjoining the Order, organizational reactions, and independent academic and policy analysis.

Key factual findings (short):
- EO 14246 directs immediate suspension/review of active security clearances for Jenner & Block employees, agency suspension of federal services and facilities provided to the firm, agency contracting reviews and potential termination of contracts, disclosure requirements by government contractors about business with Jenner, restrictions on agency engagement and hiring of Jenner staff, and an inter‑agency Title VII review of the firm’s employment practices. ([Federal Register / govinfo](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2025-03-28/pdf/2025-05519.pdf))  
- Jenner sued; the U.S. District Court for D.C. granted summary judgment for Jenner, permanently enjoining the Order as unconstitutional (First Amendment retaliation, viewpoint discrimination, due process, and Sixth Amendment concerns). The court ordered that the Order be enjoined and noted the government must rescind enforcement. ([Justia opinion / D.D.C.](https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/district-of-columbia/dcdce/1:2025cv00916/278932/138/))  
- Civil‑liberties and bar groups characterized the Order as an attack on the independence of the legal profession and a form of political retaliation. ([ACLU press release](https://www.aclu.org/press-releases/aclu-reacts-to-president-trumps-executive-order-targeting-jenner-block))

## 1. The "official" actions — what EO 14246 directs (concise list)

High‑level summary of operative directives (text‑based, paraphrased):

- Suspend and review any active security clearances held by individuals at Jenner & Block, pending an interagency review. ([govinfo / Federal Register](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2025-03-28/pdf/2025-05519.pdf))
- Direct OMB and heads of agencies to identify contracts and engagements with Jenner and entities that do business with Jenner; require agencies to submit assessments to OMB within 30 days and, to the extent permitted by law (including the FAR), take steps to terminate contracts and disfavor entities that associate with Jenner. ([Federal Register](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/03/28/2025-05519/addressing-risks-from-jenner-and-block))
- Instruct agencies to identify and cease the provision of government goods, property, services (including SCIF access) to Jenner where permitted by law. ([govinfo](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2025-03-28/pdf/2025-05519.pdf))
- Require government contractors (where legally permitted) to disclose business they do with Jenner and whether the business relates to the government contract at issue. ([Federal Register](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/03/28/2025-05519/addressing-risks-from-jenner-and-block))

## 2. What it claims to do and why — official justification (neutral summary)

The Order frames itself as a national‑security and public‑interest protection measure: the Administration characterizes “Big Law” pro bono and politically sensitive representations as presenting risks to national security, public safety, election integrity, and the "interests of the United States." The background section of the EO asserts that certain firms engage in conduct—including selective political litigation, rehiring of controversial attorneys, and allegedly discriminatory employment practices—that the Administration deems inimical to national interests. The Order therefore claims legal authority under Article II and statutes to (1) suspend access by individuals whose work may present national security risks, (2) prevent taxpayer dollars from indirectly supporting such activities, and (3) investigate discriminatory personnel practices. ([govinfo / Federal Register](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2025-03-28/pdf/2025-05519.pdf); [American Presidency Project](https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/executive-order-14246-addressing-risks-from-jenner-block)).

The Administration publicly presented the EO as a targeted risk‑management tool: to identify and to the extent permitted by law, cut off government support, facilities, and contracting relationships when a firm’s activities are judged to threaten the national interest. The White House also connected the EO to a broader set of "Addressing Risks from..." EOs aimed at several major law firms. ([Federal Register](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/03/28/2025-05519/addressing-risks-from-jenner-and-block)).

## 3. What the EO actually does or aims to do — deeper, critical analysis

Beyond its stated risk‑management framing, EO 14246 functions as a tool of political retaliation, institutional intimidation, and chilling of independent legal advocacy. Several mechanisms produce that result:

1. Weaponizing classification and clearance processes for political ends. By directing immediate suspension of security clearances for a private firm’s employees en masse, the EO leverages national‑security procedures not on individualized, ex parte, evidentiary showing but on categorical administrative fiat tied to speech and client selection. This displaces individualized adjudication and substitutes political judgment for security review. The district court found that Section 2’s clearance suspensions were motivated by and retaliatory for constitutionally protected advocacy and thus unlawful. ([D.D.C. opinion](https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/district-of-columbia/dcdce/1:2025cv00916/278932/138/)).

2. Using procurement authorities and contractor disclosure to coerce de‑facto blacklisting. The EO’s contracting directives (demanding contractor disclosure of relationships with Jenner and urging termination of contracts) amount to an administrative pressure campaign: agencies and contractors face incentives to sever relationships with a targeted firm or risk losing federal business. This extrajudicial conditioning of contract awards to punish protected speech raises serious First Amendment and procurement‑law concerns; independent analysis warned it would force consolidation and concentrate purchasing power in the hands of compliant vendors. ([Federal Register; Brookings analysis](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/03/28/2025-05519/addressing-risks-from-jenner-and-block); [Brookings](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/main-street-undermined-the-federal-decision-to-shift-contracting-from-small-innovators-to-corporate-giants-and-ways-to-fix-it/)).

3. Chilling pro bono and adversarial representation. By publicly naming firms and linking their pro bono choices to “national interest” harms, the EO creates a deterrent effect: firms and individual attorneys rationally avoid controversial representation to prevent administrative penalties—an outcome antithetical to the adversary system and access to counsel. The court recognized this chilling effect as an especially severe First Amendment concern. ([Columbia Global Freedom of Expression analysis; D.D.C. opinion](https://globalfreedomofexpression.columbia.edu/cases/jenner-v-us-department-of-justice/), https://law.justia.com/cases/.../138/).

4. Institutional capture and favoritism. The Order’s architecture—directing OMB and agency heads to align funding decisions with Presidential priorities and to "disfavor" entities that do business with targeted firms—creates mechanisms for patronage and preferential contracting for ideology‑aligned vendors. Critics noted the EO fits within a pattern of centralizing contracting power at a narrow set of vendors (category management and GSA vehicles) which benefits large firms and corporations that play by the Administration's rules. ([Brookings](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/main-street-undermined-the-federal-decision-to-shift-contracting-from-small-innovators-to-corporate-giants-and-ways-to-fix-it/)).

In short, the EO uses the machinery of national security, procurement, personnel, and civil‑rights enforcement not primarily to address individualized security threats or unlawful discrimination, but to penalize viewpoint and litigation choices the President dislikes—backstopping political retaliation with administrative tools.

## 4. How and why this damage fits into the administration’s broader strategy

EO 14246 is not an isolated act. It is one node in a coordinated series of EOs targeting multiple major law firms (Perkins Coie, Paul Weiss, WilmerHale, Susman Godfrey, etc.) and broader administrative moves to centralize executive power over agencies, procurement, and civil‑service norms. The pattern is threefold:

- Normalize administrative retaliation: By repeatedly using EOs to target law firms and civic institutions that oppose the Administration, the executive normalizes using non‑judicial administrative levers for political repression.
- Concentrate power and influence compliance: Directing agencies to align funding decisions with Presidential priorities enables executive discretion to reward compliant firms, concentrate federal contracting in friendly hands, and marginalize dissenting legal actors.
- Erode institutional independence: Targeting the legal profession—counsel who represent adversaries or unpopular clients—weakens the adversary system, discourages independent enforcement of rights, and undermines judicial review as a check on government abuses.

Together these moves advance a strategy that substitutes political litmus tests and administrative discipline for neutral governance, thereby centralizing policy control and deterring dissent—core features of an authoritarian drift. The court’s injunctions and civil‑society responses framed the EOs as an assault on a "pillar of a free society"—the independence of lawyers and bar institutions. ([ACLU](https://www.aclu.org/press-releases/aclu-reacts-to-president-trumps-executive-order-targeting-jenner-block); [D.D.C. opinion](https://law.justia.com/cases/.../138/)).

## 5. Concrete harms caused by EO 14246

- Immediate disruption to client representation: government clients and contractors informed Jenner teams they could not participate in meetings; clients sought alternative counsel, causing loss of legal continuity and client injury. ([Columbia Global Freedom of Expression](https://globalfreedomofexpression.columbia.edu/cases/jenner-v-us-department-of-justice/))
- Chilling of pro bono/defense representation: law firms curtailed or reconsidered politically sensitive pro bono matters to avoid administrative penalties; access to counsel for marginalized groups is thereby reduced.
- Economic harm to targeted firms and associated vendors: forced contract terminations or risk thereof threaten revenues (noted that ~40% of Jenner revenue relates to government contractor work per court filings/analysis), with potential ripple effects to employees and dependent markets. ([Columbia Global Freedom of Expression; D.D.C. filings](https://globalfreedomofexpression.columbia.edu/cases/jenner-v-us-department-of-justice/))
- Institutional and constitutional injury: viewpoint discrimination and retaliation undermine First Amendment rights of firms and clients; the Order interferes with Sixth Amendment and due‑process interests by chilling representation and using executive levers to punish litigation choices. ([D.D.C. opinion](https://law.justia.com/cases/.../138/))
- Broader market and democratic effects: procurement coercion risks concentrating federal contracting into politically compliant vendors (exacerbating oligopolistic trends flagged by procurement scholars), reducing competition and innovation. ([Brookings](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/main-street-undermined-the-federal-decision-to-shift-contracting-from-small-innovators-to-corporate-giants-and-ways-to-fix-it/))

## 6. Three concrete remedial actions for the next administration

1. Immediate Executive Rescission + Agency Directives  
   Issue a rescission EO or Presidential memorandum revoking EO 14246 and direct OMB, DOJ, DNI, GSA, and agency heads to (a) restore any suspended security clearances absent individualized, documented national‑security determinations; (b) re‑establish any suspended agency services/property access; and (c) withdraw contracting notices or requirements seeking disclosure/termination tied to the EO. (See process examples and prior rescission practice on WhiteHouse.gov). ([White House rescissions example / Federal Register EO text](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2025-03-28/pdf/2025-05519.pdf)).

2. OMB/DOJ Guidance and Oversight on Non‑Retaliation and Procurement Protections  
   Direct OMB and DOJ to issue uniform guidance that (a) forbids conditioning procurement decisions on the viewpoint or litigation choices of contractors or their counsel; (b) clarifies limits under the FAR and procurement statutes; and (c) institutes an interagency review and remediation plan (including replacement or restoration of contracts unfairly terminated under EO‑derived pressure). (Refer to FAR and OMB authority for procurement policy).

3. Legislative and Regulatory Protections for Legal Representation and Anti‑Retaliation  
   Work with Congress to craft a statutory "Anti‑Retaliation for Legal Representation" provision (amending Title 5 administrative code and procurement statutes as needed) that bars federal agencies from imposing penalties or debarment based on a firm’s representation choices or the political viewpoints of its clients, and funds oversight and enforcement (GAO/Inspector General review). Simultaneously, direct EEOC and OPM to rescind any investigative actions taken under the EO and issue statements protecting employers and employees from politicized employment reviews. (See EEOC/OPM authorities for administrative implementation.)

## 7. Conclusion — assessment and opinion

EO 14246 represented a direct and unprecedented politicization of core administrative levers—security clearances, procurement, facility access, hiring—and used those levers to punish and deter constitutionally protected legal advocacy. The D.C. District Court’s thorough judgment that the EO violated the First Amendment and other constitutional protections—and later judicial direction that enforcement must be rescinded—confirms both the legal vulnerability and the extraordinary constitutional stakes. This Order’s design and its siblings form a coherent pattern that strengthens executive control over dissent‑facing institutions while degrading adversarial legal protections essential to democratic governance.

In my judgment (and consistent with the court and civil‑liberties organizations), reversing the EO’s effects requires both immediate executive steps (rescission and agency remediation) and a longer legislative/regulatory project to safeguard the independence of counsel, the integrity of procurement, and the neutrality of personnel/security processes against future politicized exploitation.
