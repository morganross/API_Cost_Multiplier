Our name for the EO, that is descriptive and derisive and accurate.
“Blacklisting Lawyers for Dissent: The Jenner & Block Retaliation Order.”

A list of what the EO does.
- Orders suspension of any active security clearances held by Jenner & Block personnel “pending a review,” and directs agencies and the Director of National Intelligence to act “immediately.” ([Office of the Federal Register, 2025](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/03/28/2025-05519/addressing-risks-from-jenner-and-block)).
- Directs the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to identify all government goods/services provided to the firm and instructs agencies to “expeditiously cease” such support to the extent permitted by law. ([White House, 2025](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/addressing-risks-from-jenner-block/)).
- Compels government contractors to disclose any business relationships with Jenner & Block as a condition of federal contracting; instructs agencies to review and, “to the maximum extent” permitted, terminate contracts with Jenner & Block or entities that “do business with” the firm; requires agencies to report to OMB within 30 days on contracts and actions taken. ([White House, 2025](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/addressing-risks-from-jenner-block/)).
- Directs agency heads to restrict Jenner & Block employees’ access to federal buildings and government personnel, and to refrain from hiring firm employees absent a high-level waiver—singling out specific named individuals. ([White House, 2025](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/addressing-risks-from-jenner-block/)).
- Cross-references and aligns with a series of similar orders against other law firms and with EO 14147 (“Ending the Weaponization of the Federal Government”), embedding the blacklisting within a broader “weaponization” policy frame. ([Office of the Federal Register, 2025](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/01/28/2025-01900/ending-the-weaponization-of-the-federal-government)).

What it claims to do and why it claims to do it.
On its face, EO 14246 asserts it is “addressing the significant risks associated with law firms, particularly so-called ‘Big Law’ firms,” claiming that certain firms threaten national security, public safety, constitutional freedoms, and the integrity of elections. It accuses “powerful pro bono practices” of funneling client resources to “destructive causes.” To mitigate these alleged risks, the EO directs clearance suspensions, contracting disclosures leading to potential termination, and personnel-access restrictions, asserting agencies should align funding decisions with “American interests” and the Administration’s priorities (including EO 14147). The White House version highlights sections on security clearances, contracting disclosure and termination, and personnel/access controls, and includes boilerplate “to the extent permitted by law” caveats. In short, the government’s stated rationale is that national security and taxpayer protection justify enhanced scrutiny and disentitlement for a named firm and its associates. ([Office of the Federal Register, 2025](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/03/28/2025-05519/addressing-risks-from-jenner-and-block); [White House, 2025](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/addressing-risks-from-jenner-block/)).

What nefarious thing it actually does or aims to do.
Beneath the security pretext, EO 14246 is a viewpoint‑based blacklisting regime that punishes a private law firm—and, by extension, its clients and prospective clients—for protected advocacy and association. The District Court for the District of Columbia concluded that EO 14246 “violates settled First Amendment law” and enjoined it in full, explicitly finding that the order targeted Jenner & Block for the causes and clients it represented and for speech the Administration disfavored—classic unconstitutional retaliation and viewpoint discrimination. The court emphasized the order’s directives to cut access to federal buildings and personnel, restrict hiring, and compel disclosure leading to contract termination as mechanisms that chill legal representation and burden association rights, rather than protect legitimate national security interests. ([Bates, J., D.D.C., 2025](https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/district-of-columbia/dcdce/1:2025cv00916/278932/138/)).

EO 14246 is also part of a broader pattern: nearly identical orders against Perkins Coie (EO 14230) and WilmerHale (EO 14250) were struck down and permanently enjoined by other D.D.C. judges on multiple constitutional grounds, including First Amendment retaliation and compelled association/disclosure. These rulings document the same playbook: sweeping clearance suspensions, de facto debarment via disclosure‑driven contracting review, and access/hiring prohibitions weaponized to coerce and punish disfavored advocacy. The Perkins Coie ruling characterized the approach as an “unprecedented attack” on the legal system, declaring the order “null and void.” ([Howell, J., D.D.C., 2025](https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/district-of-columbia/dcdce/1:2025cv00716/278290/185/)).

To see the divergence between the stated and actual effects, compare the EO’s sections with their practical implications:

| EO 14246 Section | Government’s claimed purpose | Practical effect on rights and process |
|---|---|---|
| §2 Security clearance “review” | Protect national security | Mass suspension orders tied to employer identity, not individualized risk—used as leverage to chill lawful advocacy and separate firms from sensitive clients/processes ([Bates, J., 2025](https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/district-of-columbia/dcdce/1:2025cv00916/278932/138/)). |
| §3 Contracting disclosure and termination | Guard taxpayer funds, fight “discrimination” | Viewpoint‑based compelled disclosure that burdens associational privacy, triggers retaliatory contract terminations, and chills clients from hiring the firm ([Howell, J., 2025](https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/district-of-columbia/dcdce/1:2025cv00716/278290/185/)). |
| §5 Personnel/access limits | Manage agency risk | Blacklist named lawyers and staff, blocking building access and agency engagement—directly impairing the right to petition government and represent clients effectively ([Bates, J., 2025](https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/district-of-columbia/dcdce/1:2025cv00916/278932/138/)). |

Beyond the individual rights harm, EO 14246 centralizes control in OMB and the White House by forcing rapid 30‑day agency reporting, instructing policy alignment with presidential priorities, and employing government‑wide implementation leverage. Courts found that these features, as applied to law firms, lack legitimate, evidence‑based justification and instead implement a punishment agenda dressed as procurement and security management ([Office of the Federal Register, 2025](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/03/28/2025-05519/addressing-risks-from-jenner-and-block); [Bates, J., 2025](https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/district-of-columbia/dcdce/1:2025cv00916/278932/138/)).

How and why the damage done by this Trump action fits into his broader nefarious plans.
EO 14246 sits within an integrated architecture of executive actions presented as “ending weaponization” while, in practice, weaponizing state power to punish perceived enemies, deter litigation against the government, and privilege favored ideological positions. The pattern includes a suite of EOs targeting multiple law firms and cross‑referencing a central “weaponization” frame (EO 14147). Together, these actions attempt to reshape the legal marketplace by:

- Signaling that representing disfavored clients carries systemic, state‑imposed costs (blocked access, lost clearances, contract cancellations).
- Conditioning economic participation (federal contracts and participation in regulated processes) on disclosures of private associational ties that subject firms and their clients to reprisal.
- Using centralized White House/OMB direction to force uniform, government‑wide compliance that bypasses normal agency processes and neutral standards.

Independent observers note that three separate D.C. federal judges enjoined these orders, underscoring a judicial consensus that such EOs are a tool for retaliation and the suppression of disfavored advocacy. The government’s litigation posture—asserting clearance decisions are immune from review and minimizing the real‑world harms—aligns with a broader strategy to concentrate unreviewable executive authority and hollow out institutional checks. In effect, professional legal opposition is chilled, the right to petition is impaired, and the rule of law is bent toward executive convenience—all hallmarks of an authoritarian playbook that centralizes power and degrades pluralistic democratic contestation ([Georgetown Free Speech Project, 2025](https://freespeechproject.georgetown.edu/tracker-entries/three-d-c-federal-judges-overturn-executive-orders-targeting-elite-law-firms-trump-appeals-one-of-the-rulings/)).

Describe what harm this EO causes.
Even though EO 14246 was ultimately enjoined, the record reflects concrete harms from its issuance and initial implementation:

- Immediate chilling of representation and association: Firms and clients reacted in the days following issuance by terminating relationships, fearing the loss of access to federal decision‑makers, building access, and sensitive matters. Courts credited these harms as real, not speculative, and as First Amendment injuries that cannot be undone with later relief ([Howell, J., 2025](https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/district-of-columbia/dcdce/1:2025cv00716/278290/185/); [Bates, J., 2025](https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/district-of-columbia/dcdce/1:2025cv00916/278932/138/)).
- Structural disadvantage for disfavored litigants: By blocking law firm access to agency spaces and personnel and attempting mass suspension of clearances based on employer, the EO undermines the right to petition and skews administrative and national security processes in favor of executive preferences, not neutral rule‑of‑law considerations. This undermines procedural fairness and due process for affected clients needing advocacy in complex administrative regimes ([Bates, J., 2025](https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/district-of-columbia/dcdce/1:2025cv00916/278932/138/)).
- Coercive procurement leverage: Mandated disclosure of business ties to the targeted firm and instruction to terminate, “to the maximum extent permitted,” imposes compelled association burdens and effectively blacklists both the firm and adjacent contractors, magnifying the chilling effect deep into supply chains and partner ecosystems ([Howell, J., 2025](https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/district-of-columbia/dcdce/1:2025cv00716/278290/185/)).
- Centralization and politicization of agency discretion: The EO’s 30‑day reporting to OMB and directives to align funding with the President’s policy preferences insert overt ideological control into routine contracting and personnel‑access decisions, degrading agency independence and normal guardrails against politicized retaliation ([Office of the Federal Register, 2025](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/03/28/2025-05519/addressing-risks-from-jenner-and-block)).
- Systemic degradation of the rule of law: Three separate district judges’ rulings across related firm‑targeting EOs emphasize that these orders strike at the core of First Amendment protections and the functioning of the adversarial system—lawyers’ ability to represent unpopular clients without fear of state retribution. The damage is not only to named firms but to the public’s access to counsel willing to challenge government action ([Georgetown Free Speech Project, 2025](https://freespeechproject.georgetown.edu/tracker-entries/three-d-c-federal-judges-overturn-executive-orders-targeting-elite-law-firms-trump-appeals-one-of-the-rulings/)).

Propose three concrete actions for the next administration to undo the damage done by Trump.
- Repeal and replace: On Day 1, revoke EO 14246 and all related “law firm targeting” orders, and issue a binding OMB/DOJ/ODNI joint directive instructing immediate, government‑wide compliance, including rescission of any implementing guidance, reporting requirements, or access restrictions that were promulgated under those EOs ([Office of the Federal Register landing page for Executive Orders](https://www.federalregister.gov/presidential-documents/executive-orders)).
- Codify protections against viewpoint‑based blacklisting: Propose and support passage of a Legal Advocacy Non‑Discrimination Act that bars federal entities from conditioning clearances, contracting eligibility, building access, or agency engagement on a law firm’s clients, causes, or viewpoints; direct OLC to issue an opinion and agencies to adopt regulations aligning security clearance adjudication with individualized, evidence‑based standards (SEAD consistency) rather than categorical employer‑based suspensions ([U.S. Department of Justice](https://www.justice.gov/); [Office of the Director of National Intelligence](https://www.dni.gov/index.php/sead)).
- Procurement rulemaking to protect associational privacy: Through the FAR Council and OMB, initiate rulemaking to prohibit compelled disclosure of law‑firm business relationships in procurement absent a clear, statutory basis and a narrowly tailored, compelling interest, thereby restoring associational protections and preventing de facto viewpoint‑based debarment ([Office of Management and Budget](https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/)).
