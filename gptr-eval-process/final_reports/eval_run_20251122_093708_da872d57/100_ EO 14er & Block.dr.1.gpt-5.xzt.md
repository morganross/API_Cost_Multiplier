Our name for the EO
Blacklisting Lawyers to Punish Dissent and Chill Advocacy

What the EO does
EO 14246 expressly singles out one private law firm (Jenner & Block) and directs multiple punitive actions across security, procurement, access to government, and employment pipelines. The core directives are:

- Security clearance suspension: Orders the Attorney General, Director of National Intelligence, and other agency heads to “immediately” suspend any active security clearances held by Jenner & Block personnel pending review for “consistency with the national interest.” It further directs agencies to identify and stop providing government goods, property, services, and Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility (SCIF) access to the firm, to the extent permitted by law (Executive Office of the President, 2025) ([Executive Office of the President, 2025](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2025-03-28/pdf/2025-05519.pdf)).

- Contracting and disclosure regime: Requires government contracting agencies, “to the extent permissible by law,” to require federal contractors to disclose any business they do with Jenner & Block and whether it relates to the contract; requires agencies to review all contracts with Jenner and with entities that do business with Jenner; and instructs agencies, where permissible, to terminate contracts for which Jenner has been hired to perform any service (The American Presidency Project, 2025) ([The American Presidency Project, 2025](https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/executive-order-14246-addressing-risks-from-jenner-block)).

- Access and personnel restrictions: Directs limitations on Jenner employees’ access to federal buildings, engagement with federal personnel, and imposes hiring prohibitions for agency positions absent special authorization (as reflected in Section 5 and subsequent guidance directives described in litigation records) (Columbia Global Freedom of Expression, 2025) ([Columbia Global Freedom of Expression, 2025](https://globalfreedomofexpression.columbia.edu/cases/jenner-v-us-department-of-justice/)).

- Cross-referencing for broader application: Aligns agency funding decisions with administration priorities “especially” EO 14147 (“Ending the Weaponization of the Federal Government”), and incorporates by reference authority used in another law-firm-targeting order (EO 14230) (The American Presidency Project, 2025) ([The American Presidency Project, 2025](https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/executive-order-14246-addressing-risks-from-jenner-block)).

- Immediate and sweeping scope: The operative sections (2–5) were designed to take immediate effect and required rapid agency reporting to OMB on contract relationships and actions taken (The American Presidency Project, 2025) ([The American Presidency Project, 2025](https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/executive-order-14246-addressing-risks-from-jenner-block)).

Notably, on May 23, 2025, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia declared sections 2–5 of EO 14246 unconstitutional, “null and void,” and permanently enjoined the government from implementing them, directing agencies to rescind all related guidance (U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, 2025) ([U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, 2025](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/USCOURTS-dcd-1_25-cv-00916/pdf/USCOURTS-dcd-1_25-cv-00916-1.pdf)).

What it claims to do and why it claims to do it
The EO purports to protect the “interests of the United States” by addressing claimed “risks” arising from the activities of certain “Big Law” firms, specifically naming Jenner & Block. The stated justifications assert that:

- The firm’s conduct is detrimental to U.S. interests and national security, including alleged discriminatory employment practices, politicized litigation, and the rehiring of a former DOJ official associated with the Mueller investigation. The order frames these as degradations of “the profession’s highest ideals” and as threats to national security and justice (Executive Office of the President, 2025) ([Executive Office of the President, 2025](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2025-03-28/pdf/2025-05519.pdf)).

- National security and “public interest” rationales warrant immediate suspension and review of security clearances, cessation of government support services, and procurement-based pressure (contract termination and disclosure) to prevent taxpayer dollars from “subsidizing” activities “not aligned with American interests” (The American Presidency Project, 2025) ([The American Presidency Project, 2025](https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/executive-order-14246-addressing-risks-from-jenner-block)).

- The EO explicitly aligns with the administration’s broader agenda in EO 14147 (“Ending the Weaponization of the Federal Government”) and borrows or defers to other law-firm-targeting authorities (e.g., EO 14230 on Perkins Coie) to signal a systemic “cleanup” of purportedly politicized legal practices (The American Presidency Project, 2025) ([The American Presidency Project, 2025](https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/executive-order-14246-addressing-risks-from-jenner-block)).

In short, the EO’s official narrative is that targeting a named private law firm is necessary to protect national security, prevent discrimination, and ensure taxpayer funds do not fund adversarial legal work presented as contrary to U.S. interests (Executive Office of the President, 2025) ([Executive Office of the President, 2025](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2025-03-28/pdf/2025-05519.pdf)).

What nefarious thing it actually does or aims to do
Behind the rhetoric, EO 14246 functions as an overt, viewpoint-based blacklist designed to punish protected legal advocacy, deter representation disfavored by the President, and intimidate the broader legal profession. The law is clear: punishing an entity for lawful speech, representation, or association is unconstitutional. A federal court found that EO 14246 was “retaliation” for protected speech and “viewpoint discrimination,” and permanently enjoined enforcement of Sections 2–5 as null and void (U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, 2025) ([U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, 2025](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/USCOURTS-dcd-1_25-cv-00916/pdf/USCOURTS-dcd-1_25-cv-00916-1.pdf)).

Mechanisms of coercion embedded in the EO include:

- Security clearance weaponization: Immediate suspension of clearances for a category of private citizens, not for individualized counterintelligence reasons, but for their affiliation with a disfavored firm and its legal work—an abuse of national-security discretion to achieve political ends (Columbia Global Freedom of Expression, 2025) ([Columbia Global Freedom of Expression, 2025](https://globalfreedomofexpression.columbia.edu/cases/jenner-v-us-department-of-justice/)).

- Procurement blacklisting-by-proxy: Indirectly punishing third-party contractors and chilling their use of counsel by turning procurement disclosure and termination reviews into a loyalty test—deterring companies from associating with targeted firms to protect federal revenues (The American Presidency Project, 2025; U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, 2025) ([The American Presidency Project, 2025](https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/executive-order-14246-addressing-risks-from-jenner-block); [U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, 2025](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/USCOURTS-dcd-1_25-cv-00916/pdf/USCOURTS-dcd-1_25-cv-00916-1.pdf)).

- Access and hiring bans: Blocking access to federal buildings and interactions with federal personnel disrupts attorney-client work that requires agency engagement, and de facto blacklists employment pathways, signaling to the bar that representing disfavored clients may end careers (Columbia Global Freedom of Expression, 2025) ([Columbia Global Freedom of Expression, 2025](https://globalfreedomofexpression.columbia.edu/cases/jenner-v-us-department-of-justice/)).

- Intimidation beyond a single firm: By naming one firm and layering procurement, clearance, and access penalties, the EO sends a chilling message to all lawyers and clients: represent disfavored causes, and the federal government will make you radioactive (Columbia Global Freedom of Expression, 2025) ([Columbia Global Freedom of Expression, 2025](https://globalfreedomofexpression.columbia.edu/cases/jenner-v-us-department-of-justice/)).

Importantly, there is no evidence of a regularized, lawful acquisition policy implementation: there are no OMB memoranda or FAR Council directives implementing EO 14246; and contemporaneous FAR “Revolutionary FAR Overhaul (RFO)” class deviations cite other authorities (EO 14275; OMB M‑25‑26) but not EO 14246. In other words, the federal acquisition apparatus did not institutionalize this blacklist—consistent with the courts’ orders enjoining it (OMB, 2025; GSA, 2025) ([OMB, 2025](https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/information-resources/guidance/memoranda/); [GSA, 2025](https://www.gsa.gov/policy-regulations/policy/acquisition-policy/acquisition-policy-library-and-resources/rfo202506)).

How and why the damage done by this Trump action fits into his broader nefarious plans
EO 14246 does not stand alone. It fits a pattern of executive actions targeting private law firms by name (e.g., EO 14230 on Perkins Coie; EO 14250 on WilmerHale), cross-referencing EO 14147 (“Ending the Weaponization of the Federal Government”) to justify sweeping punitive directives against adversarial speech and advocacy. Independent observers have documented this synchronized campaign and the rapid judicial pushback that followed (Georgetown Free Speech Project, 2025) ([Georgetown Free Speech Project, 2025](https://freespeechproject.georgetown.edu/tracker-entries/three-d-c-federal-judges-overturn-executive-orders-targeting-elite-law-firms-trump-appeals-one-of-the-rulings/)).

Strategically, this pattern:

- Centralizes power by normalizing personalized executive punishment, bypassing neutral legal standards, and chilling litigation that constrains the President.

- Undermines separation of powers by deterring court challenges and interfering with defendants’ rights to counsel—especially where representation requires federal building access, secure communications, or security clearances.

- Weaponizes procurement to create a government-enforced market boycott against disfavored speakers, signaling to corporate America that continued access to federal revenue requires ideological compliance.

- Delegitimizes civil rights enforcement by transforming Title VII scrutiny into a cudgel applied on ideological grounds—contrary to neutral enforcement principles and judicial oversight.

In aggregate, this is an authoritarian template: use of the “national security” label to justify collective punishment; leveraging procurement and administrative choke points to enforce loyalty; and explicitly naming private entities for reprisal to produce a chilling effect across the profession and civil society. Courts recognized these features—calling EO 14246 an unconstitutional act of retaliation and enjoining its core provisions (U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, 2025) ([U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, 2025](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/USCOURTS-dcd-1_25-cv-00916/pdf/USCOURTS-dcd-1_25-cv-00916-1.pdf)).

Describe what harm this EO causes
Although enjoined, EO 14246’s design and early effects caused several concrete harms and posed systemic risks:

- Chilling legal advocacy and right to counsel: By threatening clearances, access, and hiring paths, the EO chills representation in sensitive matters (national security, criminal defense, immigration), reducing clients’ ability to find counsel willing to accept heightened government risk and surveillance (Columbia Global Freedom of Expression, 2025) ([Columbia Global Freedom of Expression, 2025](https://globalfreedomofexpression.columbia.edu/cases/jenner-v-us-department-of-justice/)).

- Economic coercion of third parties: The disclosure-and-termination regime aimed to pressure federal contractors to avoid doing business with “blacklisted” firms—creating de facto economic sanctions against legal service providers and their clients, with spillover costs throughout supply chains (The American Presidency Project, 2025) ([The American Presidency Project, 2025](https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/executive-order-14246-addressing-risks-from-jenner-block)).

- Immediate operational disruption: The EO’s suspension of clearances and access to federal facilities would have impaired ongoing representations, from classified matters to routine agency advocacy and courthouse logistics. Court records emphasize how such restrictions would stigmatize the firm with a “government-inscribed scarlet letter” and jeopardize future income, particularly where a substantial share of firm revenue depends on government-related clients (JURIST, 2025) ([JURIST, 2025](https://www.jurist.org/news/2025/05/us-federal-court-permanently-blocks-executive-order-targeting-law-firm/)).

- Institutional degradation: Normalizing a named, politically motivated blacklist of a private law firm corrodes rule-of-law expectations across the federal security and procurement systems. It signals to career officials that content- and viewpoint-based punishments are acceptable, undermining neutral process and increasing the risk of future abuses—even beyond legal services (U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, 2025) ([U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, 2025](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/USCOURTS-dcd-1_25-cv-00916/pdf/USCOURTS-dcd-1_25-cv-00916-1.pdf)).

To illustrate the EO’s mechanisms and harms, the table below maps the operative sections to their practical effects:

| EO 14246 Section | Directive (summary) | Practical effect if enforced |
|---|---|---|
| Sec. 2 | Suspend security clearances held by Jenner personnel; cease provision of government goods/services, including SCIF access | Disrupts classified and sensitive representations; stigmatizes affiliation; uses national security tools for political punishment |
| Sec. 3 | Require contractors to disclose business with Jenner; review and terminate contracts with Jenner; review entities doing business with Jenner | Chills contractor engagement with disfavored counsel; creates government-pressured market boycott; undermines neutral acquisition principles |
| Sec. 4 | Cross-reference to another law-firm targeting EO (Perkins Coie) | Expands a template to punish disfavored advocacy across firms |
| Sec. 5 | Limit access to federal buildings/personnel; bar agency hiring from Jenner absent special permission | Impairs ongoing representations; threatens career mobility; signals that legal dissent harms livelihoods |

What followed confirms both intent and effect: a federal court permanently enjoined the EO’s operative sections as unconstitutional retaliation and viewpoint discrimination, ordering agencies to rescind related guidance—an unusually broad remedy reflecting the order’s severity (U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, 2025) ([U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, 2025](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/USCOURTS-dcd-1_25-cv-00916/pdf/USCOURTS-dcd-1_25-cv-00916-1.pdf)).

Propose three concrete actions for the next administration to undo the damage
- Rescind EO 14246 in full and issue a successor executive order affirming attorney independence and prohibiting viewpoint-based targeting in federal security, procurement, and access decisions; instruct all agencies to certify rescission of any formal or informal directives issued pursuant to EO 14246 (Executive Office of the President, 2025) ([Executive Office of the President, 2025](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2025-03-28/pdf/2025-05519.pdf)).

- Direct OMB/OFPP and the FAR Council to publish governmentwide guidance and, if needed, FAR amendments reaffirming that acquisition decisions may not condition eligibility or source selection on a vendor’s use of particular legal counsel, legal arguments, or associational ties, except as required by statute or legitimate conflict-of-interest rules; require public posting on Acquisition.gov (OMB; GSA/FAR Council) ([OMB, 2025](https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/information-resources/guidance/memoranda/); [GSA, 2025](https://www.gsa.gov/policy-regulations/policy/acquisition-policy/acquisition-policy-library-and-resources/rfo202506)).

- Propose legislation codifying prohibitions on viewpoint-based use of security clearance authorities, building access restrictions, and procurement exclusion against legal service providers or their clients; require individualized, articulable, and reviewable national-security rationales, coupled with expedited judicial review where First Amendment or right-to-counsel interests are implicated (U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, 2025) ([U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, 2025](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/USCOURTS-dcd-1_25-cv-00916/pdf/USCOURTS-dcd-1_25-cv-00916-1.pdf)).
