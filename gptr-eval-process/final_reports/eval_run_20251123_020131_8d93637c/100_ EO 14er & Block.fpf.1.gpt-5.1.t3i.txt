## Official Title of the Executive Order

**Executive Order 14246 — “Addressing Risks From Jenner & Block”**

This deliberately vague title suggests a neutral risk-management exercise, when the substance of the order is a targeted punishment of a single private law firm and its lawyers.

## Our Name for the Executive Order

**Executive Order 14246 – The “Retaliate Against Dissenting Lawyers” Order Targeting Jenner & Block**

This captures what the EO actually is: not a neutral safeguarding of national security, but an overt use of presidential power to intimidate and financially damage a law firm that has represented clients and causes Trump dislikes, and that re-hired one of his most visible legal critics.

## What the Executive Order Does

In operative terms, EO 14246 directs the federal executive branch to treat Jenner & Block LLP and its personnel as if they were a security risk and political enemy, and to mobilize the machinery of clearances, contracts, and hiring against them. Key provisions:

- **Smears Jenner & Block in an official presidential “Background” section.**  
  The order declares that “Big Law” firms pose “significant risks” to national security and constitutional values, accuses Jenner & Block of “partisan ‘lawfare,’” of supporting “attacks against women and children” by refusing to accept “the biological reality of sex,” of “back[ing] the obstruction” of efforts against undocumented immigrants and drugs, and of discriminating through race‑based diversity targets. It singles out former Mueller prosecutor Andrew Weissmann by name as emblematic of this supposed threat.

- **Suspends security clearances for Jenner & Block personnel.**  
  Section 2 orders the Attorney General, Director of National Intelligence, and all “relevant” agency heads to immediately suspend any active security clearances held by individuals at Jenner & Block, pending review of whether those clearances are “consistent with the national interest.”

- **Cuts off access to federal facilities and resources.**  
  The Office of Management and Budget must identify all government property, services, and secure facilities (including SCIFs) provided for Jenner’s benefit, and agencies are told to “expeditiously cease” such provision.

- **Weaponizes federal contracting against the firm.**  
  Section 3 requires all government contracting agencies to force contractors to disclose any business with Jenner & Block, and whether that business relates to the government contract. Agencies must then review any contracts with Jenner or with entities that do business with Jenner, and “take appropriate steps to terminate any contract” for which Jenner has been hired to perform *any* service, to the maximum extent permitted by procurement law. Agencies are also told to “align their funding decisions” with Trump’s priorities, especially EO 14147 (“Ending the Weaponization of the Federal Government”).

- **Ties the order into a broader anti‑DEI and anti–progressive‑law‑firm campaign.**  
  Section 4 states that nothing in EO 14246 limits the actions authorized by section 4 of EO 14230 (“Addressing Risks from Perkins Coie LLP”), which already directs the Attorney General to scrutinize large firms’ diversity and pro bono practices for supposed “race-based and sex-based” discrimination.

- **Blacklists Jenner & Block lawyers from government buildings and federal jobs.**  
  Section 5 instructs agency heads to restrict Jenner employees’ access to federal buildings when such access is deemed inconsistent with U.S. interests, to issue guidance limiting official engagement with Jenner lawyers (again naming Weissmann), and to refrain from hiring Jenner employees at all, absent a special waiver from the agency head and OPM.

- **Applies across the entire executive branch.**  
  The order is framed to bind “all” agencies, making this not a dispute with one agency’s contracts, but a whole-of-government directive to stigmatize and sideline a private firm.

All of this is codified in EO 14246 and its publication in the Federal Register (90 Fed. Reg. 13997–13999), and in the parallel text archived by the American Presidency Project.

## What It Claims to Do and Why It Claims to Do It

In its own words and in administration talking points, EO 14246 claims to pursue four broad objectives:

1. **Protect national security and public safety.**  
   The order asserts that certain “Big Law” firms, through their litigation and pro bono work, threaten national security, degrade election integrity, and undermine “bedrock American principles.” It insists that lawyers who engage in such activity should not “have access to our Nation’s secrets.”

2. **Safeguard taxpayer funds and contracting integrity.**  
   The EO frames its contracting provisions as ensuring that federal dollars are not “subsidizing” harmful causes supposedly funded through law firms’ pro bono programs. It purports to prevent indirect federal support for litigation and advocacy that the President deems contrary to “American interests.”

3. **Enforce civil‑rights law against alleged “reverse discrimination.”**  
   By invoking Title VII and referencing Jenner’s diversity targets, the order claims to be combating race‑based employment practices. It links this to prior orders (notably EO 14230) as part of a broader campaign to investigate “race-based and sex-based non-discrimination laws”—an inversion of anti‑discrimination language to attack DEI policies.

4. **Align executive-branch spending with “citizen interests” and the President’s priorities.**  
   Agencies are told to harmonize their funding and contracting decisions with the administration’s agenda, especially EO 14147 on “Ending the Weaponization of the Federal Government.” The implication is that any legal representation or advocacy that challenges that agenda is itself “weaponization” that must be defunded and excluded.

Taken at face value, the official story is that this is a neutral clean-up of irresponsible law firms that threaten national security and discriminate in hiring—nothing to do with punishing dissent or neutering legal opposition.

## What Nefarious Thing It Actually Does or Aims to Do

Behind the national‑security and “civil rights” window‑dressing, EO 14246 is a direct attempt to punish a disfavored law firm for its clients, its causes, and one high‑profile critic of Trump, and to send a warning shot across the entire legal profession.

1. **Retaliation against protected legal advocacy and political opposition.**  
   Jenner & Block is targeted explicitly because of its litigation against Trump‑era policies (including on immigration, asylum, transgender health care, and environmental protection) and because it re‑hired Andrew Weissmann, a former Mueller‑team prosecutor and vocal Trump critic. The order’s own text ties the firm to “partisan prosecution” in the Mueller investigation and to pro bono work on behalf of transgender people and asylum‑seekers. Independent analyses—including democracy‑protection groups and legal commentators—have documented that the order is best understood as punishment for those activities and for Weissmann’s speech, not for any credible security breach or fraud. ([democracy2025.org](https://www.democracy2025.org/response-center/eo-14246?utm_source=openai))  

2. **Turning “national security” into a partisan loyalty test.**  
   By directing agencies to suspend clearances and cut off SCIF access based solely on where people work, the order tries to redefine “risk” as “representing the wrong clients or criticizing the President.” This is classic authoritarian logic: equating opposition to the leader with danger to the state, so that ordinary professional activity (challenging government actions in court, taking on controversial clients) becomes grounds for security sanctions.

3. **Using economic coercion to discipline the bar.**  
   The contracting provisions are not aimed at a discrete misconduct problem; they are written to bleed Jenner & Block of revenue and to make it toxic in the eyes of any prime contractor that does federal work. The message to every large firm is obvious: if you represent migrants, transgender people, environmental plaintiffs, or political opponents of Trump—or rehire lawyers associated with those efforts—you risk losing not only federal work, but also private business dependent on federal contracts.

4. **Attacking DEI and pro bono as cover for a broader culture‑war purge.**  
   EO 14246 folds Jenner’s diversity policies and its pro bono docket into a narrative of “racial discrimination” and anti‑family “attacks.” This is not a serious civil‑rights enforcement strategy; it is a cudgel to delegitimize progressive lawyering and DEI inside elite institutions, and to chill the willingness of firms to invest in those areas.

5. **Creating an officially sanctioned enemies list.**  
   Naming a private firm and a specific lawyer in a presidential executive order, then instructing every federal agency to avoid hiring its alumni and to minimize contact, is functionally an enemies‑list tactic. It signals that political disloyalty—expressed through who you represent or what you say—can be punished by state power, far beyond the normal give-and-take of litigation and political speech.

In substance, this EO is not about “risks from Jenner & Block”; it is about making an example out of Jenner & Block to frighten the rest of the legal profession into staying away from Trump’s opponents and from disfavored communities.

## How and Why the Damage Done by This Trump Action Fits Into His Broader Nefarious Plans

EO 14246 cannot be understood in isolation. It is part of a coordinated campaign by the Trump–Vance administration to subjugate independent lawyers and law firms to presidential power.

1. **Part of a series of personalized attack EOs against law firms.**  
   In early 2025 Trump issued EO 14230 targeting Perkins Coie, EO 14244 addressing supposed “remedial action” by Paul Weiss, and other measures directed at WilmerHale and similar firms. These orders share a common structure: vilify the firm for its clients and DEI policies, suspend clearances, restrict building access, and threaten contracts across the executive branch. Public trackers and reference works now treat EO 14246 as one instance in a broader pattern of Trump’s second‑term “targeting of law firms and lawyers” who opposed him in court or in the Mueller investigation. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Targeting_of_law_firms_and_lawyers_under_the_second_Trump_administration?utm_source=openai))  

2. **Building an infrastructure for “rule by intimidation” over the legal system.**  
   The cumulative message of these orders is that representation adverse to the President—especially on civil‑rights, immigration, and checks on executive power—is not merely wrong but dangerous, and that the federal government will remember and retaliate. That memory is enforced through clearances, contracts, access badges, and hiring blacklists. This is how an authoritarian executive attempts to hollow out the adversarial system: by making it professionally and financially risky to be on the opposing side.

3. **Rebranding accountability as “weaponization,” then suppressing it.**  
   EO 14246 is explicitly linked to EO 14147 (“Ending the Weaponization of the Federal Government”). In practice, “weaponization” here is redefined to mean any use of law that constrains the president—independent investigations like Mueller’s, civil‑rights suits against administration policies, or challenges to voter‑suppression measures. By defunding and isolating the lawyers who bring such cases, Trump advances a long‑term objective: a presidency insulated from meaningful legal challenge and surrounded by a bar that knows it may be punished for adverse advocacy.

4. **Advancing a proto‑fascist politics of enemies and collective punishment.**  
   Fascist movements routinely delegitimize lawyers, journalists, and academics who defend minorities or challenge the leader, labelling them as traitors or threats to public safety. EO 14246 follows that script: it paints Jenner & Block as an enemy of “women and children,” of “American interests,” and of national security, and then mobilizes the state apparatus to ostracize and impoverish it. The longer‑term goal is not just to hurt one firm, but to normalize the idea that the executive may use formal state instruments to crush civil society actors who get in the way.

## What Harm This Executive Order Causes

Even though EO 14246 has been significantly curtailed in court, it has already caused—and continues to cause—real damage to individuals, institutions, and democratic governance.

1. **Immediate disruption to clients and to the firm’s ability to practice.**  
   After the order’s issuance, federal officials told at least one of Jenner’s clients that its legal team could not participate in a scheduled government meeting, solely because its lawyers worked at Jenner & Block. Even when a temporary restraining order later allowed participation, the client had already switched to different counsel. Other clients expressed concern about whether Jenner could continue to represent them effectively given the government’s hostility and restrictions, and reconsidered their relationships with the firm. Suspension of security clearances also impeded lawyers’ ability to work on matters requiring classified access, including criminal defense and military‑related service. ([globalfreedomofexpression.columbia.edu](https://globalfreedomofexpression.columbia.edu/cases/jenner-v-us-department-of-justice/?utm_source=openai))  

2. **Economic and professional harm and a chilling effect on pro bono work.**  
   The order functioned as a government‑imposed stigma, marking Jenner & Block with what one federal judge in related litigation called a kind of “scarlet letter.” By suspending clearances, threatening to terminate contracts, and restricting access to federal facilities, the EO placed the firm at a competitive disadvantage vis‑à‑vis politically favored competitors. That in turn deterred potential clients—especially those reliant on federal contracts—from hiring Jenner. In the litigation challenging EO 14246, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia (Judge John D. Bates) held that the order unconstitutionally engaged in viewpoint discrimination and retaliation, “present[ing] the law firm with two choices: ‘change its speech or suffer a serious injury to its livelihood,’” and permanently enjoined the government from implementing its operative sections. Parallel litigation over EO 14230 led Chief Judge Beryl Howell to condemn this emerging pattern as an unprecedented attack on the independence of the bar—likening it to a “cringe‑worthy twist” on the idea of “killing the lawyers [the ruler] doesn’t like”—and to strike that order down as well. ([alston.com](https://www.alston.com/en/resources/executive-order-task-force/executive-order-tracker/diversity-equity-inclusion-dei?utm_source=openai))  

3. **Reduced access to counsel for vulnerable communities.**  
   Jenner & Block is widely recognized for extensive pro bono work, including representing transgender people, asylum‑seekers, and other marginalized groups. Targeting the firm for these very representations sends a clear deterrent to other firms considering similar matters. Even where lawyers continue the work, clients must now factor in the risk that their attorneys could be singled out by the executive, have their clearances pulled, or lose access to federal facilities. Over time, this shrinks the pool of high‑quality counsel willing to take on complex rights‑based litigation against the federal government.

4. **Damage to the rule of law and to the independence of the legal profession.**  
   By converting standard tools of administration—clearances, contracting, building access, hiring—into instruments of ideological discipline, EO 14246 undermines the basic premise that lawyers can represent unpopular clients or challenge state power without fearing retaliation. The order tries to make it “normal” that the President names and attacks private firms in legally operative documents. Even with court injunctions in place, the signal to the bar has been sent: the White House is willing to use the full coercive capacity of the executive branch to punish those who stand in its way. That signal alone can alter behavior and chill advocacy in ways that courts cannot easily remedy after the fact.

5. **Erosion of democratic checks and inter‑branch balance.**  
   The practical effect of these harms is to make it harder to bring and sustain lawsuits that check executive abuses in other domains—over elections, environmental deregulation, immigration crackdowns, or attacks on protest and speech. If firms fear they will be blacklisted for representing such challenges, fewer cases are filed, fewer are pursued aggressively, and the courts receive a narrower, more timid docket. EO 14246 thus contributes to a slow‑motion weakening of judicial oversight and of the adversarial system that underpins constitutional democracy.

## Three Concrete Actions for the Next Administration to Undo the Damage

1. **Immediately rescind EO 14246 and all related law‑firm–targeting orders, and mandate neutral treatment of counsel.**  
   On day one, issue a new executive order formally revoking EO 14246 (and related orders such as EO 14230 and EO 14244), directing all agencies to disregard any blacklists or restrictions created under them, to restore any security clearances or contracts affected solely by those orders, and to adopt written policies prohibiting viewpoint‑based discrimination against law firms in clearances, contracting, and hiring (to be published in the Federal Register for transparency and accountability).

2. **Codify protections for independent legal representation in federal statute.**  
   Work with Congress to pass legislation—modeled on First Amendment and due‑process jurisprudence—that bars the federal government from conditioning security clearances, contracts, or employment opportunities on a lawyer’s clients, lawful advocacy positions, or firm pro bono docket, and that creates a private right of action and expedited judicial review when such retaliation occurs. This should include clear standards and burden‑shifting rules so that any claimed “national security” rationale must be substantiated, not merely asserted.

3. **Rebuild and insulate pro bono and civil‑rights advocacy from political retaliation.**  
   Through the Department of Justice’s Office for Access to Justice and relevant grant‑making programs, expand support for civil‑rights and pro bono work—including funding for independent legal-services organizations and bar‑association initiatives—while creating formal guarantees that participation in such work will not be used by federal agencies as a negative factor in clearances, contracts, or hiring. At the same time, encourage the ABA and state bars to adopt ethics rules explicitly condemning government retaliation against lawyers for their choice of clients or causes, reinforcing professional norms of independence alongside legal safeguards.
