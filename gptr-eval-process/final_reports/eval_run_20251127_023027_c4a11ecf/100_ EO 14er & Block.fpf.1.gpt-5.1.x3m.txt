## 1. Descriptive Characterization of Executive Order 14246

Executive Order 14246, “Addressing Risks from Jenner & Block,” is in substance a presidential blacklist of a single private law firm, weaponizing national security and federal contracting powers to punish disfavored legal advocacy. The order targets Jenner & Block LLP because of whom it has represented, what causes it has supported, and a former partner—Andrew Weissmann—who helped investigate Donald Trump in the Mueller probe. ([whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/addressing-risks-from-jenner-block/?utm_source=openai))  

A candid description of EO 14246 is: **the Executive Decree to Intimidate and Blacklist Dissenting Counsel.** It is a calculated attempt to:

- Mark the firm with a government‑imposed “scarlet letter” in the federal marketplace; ([jurist.org](https://www.jurist.org/news/2025/05/us-federal-court-permanently-blocks-executive-order-targeting-law-firm/?utm_source=openai))  
- Starve it of work connected to federal agencies and government contractors; ([whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/03/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-addresses-risks-from-jenner-block/?utm_source=openai))  
- Signal to the entire legal profession that representing clients or causes opposed by the Trump administration carries existential professional risk. ([theguardian.com](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/28/jenner-block-wilmerhale-law-firms-sue-trump?utm_source=openai))  

Where the official title speaks of “addressing risks,” the reality is a state‑sponsored campaign of retaliation against a law firm for the protected exercise of legal advocacy.

## 2. Operative Provisions of Executive Order 14246

Drawing on the text of the order and official White House materials, EO 14246 does the following: ([whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/addressing-risks-from-jenner-block/?utm_source=openai))  

- **Immediate suspension of security clearances held by Jenner & Block personnel**  
  - All security clearances for Jenner attorneys and staff are suspended, pending an “assessment” of whether continued access is in the “national interest.”  
  - This includes access to Sensitive Compartmented Information Facilities (SCIFs) and other secure spaces.

- **Cut‑off of government‑provided support and facility access**  
  - Federal agencies must halt “material and services” provided for the benefit of Jenner, including SCIF access and similar support. ([whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/03/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-addresses-risks-from-jenner-block/?utm_source=openai))  
  - Agencies are directed to limit the firm’s employees’ physical access to federal buildings when that access is deemed inconsistent with “national security” or the “interests of the United States.” ([whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/addressing-risks-from-jenner-block/?utm_source=openai))  

- **Contract review and effective blacklisting**  
  - Within 30 days, agencies must report to the Office of Management and Budget on all contracts with Jenner and with entities that “do business with Jenner,” and on steps taken under the order. ([whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/addressing-risks-from-jenner-block/?utm_source=openai))  
  - Agencies are directed to “terminate” contracts that involve Jenner, to ensure federal funds do not “subsidize” the firm’s activities.

- **Restrictions on hiring Jenner alumni into government**  
  - Agency officials are instructed to refrain from hiring former Jenner employees, including Andrew Weissmann, unless the agency head, in consultation with OPM, grants a waiver based on national‑security assurances. ([whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/addressing-risks-from-jenner-block/?utm_source=openai))  

- **Cross‑reference and extension of anti‑DEI and “lawfare” campaign**  
  - Section 4 explicitly incorporates section 4 of EO 14230, “Addressing Risks from Perkins Coie LLP,” anchoring EO 14246 in a broader program of attacking law firms over diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) practices and litigation positions disfavored by the administration. ([whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/addressing-risks-from-jenner-block/?utm_source=openai))  

- **Standard boilerplate on implementation**  
  - A concluding section asserts that the order does not create enforceable rights, while instructing agencies to implement it “consistent with applicable law” and subject to appropriations—language that does nothing to soften the order’s punitive, blacklist‑style structure. ([whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/addressing-risks-from-jenner-block/?utm_source=openai))  

Functionally, EO 14246 establishes a bespoke sanctions regime against one law firm, implemented through the powerful levers of security clearances, building access, and federal procurement.

## 3. Stated Purpose and Official Justifications

### 3.1 Official framing of the “problem”

In Section 1 of EO 14246 and in the accompanying White House fact sheet, the administration asserts that: ([whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/addressing-risks-from-jenner-block/?utm_source=openai))  

- Large law firms allegedly **“engage in conduct detrimental to critical American interests,”** including threats to public safety, national security, and “bedrock American principles.”  
- These harms are said to be driven especially by **pro bono practices**, which purportedly channel “hundreds of millions” of client dollars into “destructive causes.”  
- The order singles out law firms it claims have embraced “partisan ‘lawfare’” to achieve political ends, implying that certain civil‑rights and constitutional lawsuits are themselves abuses of the legal system.

Within that framework, the order portrays Jenner & Block as:

- Having “abandoned the profession’s highest ideals” by engaging in **“obvious partisan representations to achieve political ends”;**  
- Supporting “attacks against women and children” by refusing “the biological reality of sex,” a reference to the firm’s work on transgender rights;  
- Backing “obstruction” of efforts to stop “illegal aliens” from committing crimes, a reference to immigration and asylum litigation;  
- Discriminating against employees via “race‑based targets,” i.e., DEI initiatives. ([whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/addressing-risks-from-jenner-block/?utm_source=openai))  

The administration further highlights Jenner’s past employment of Andrew Weissmann and characterizes his role in the Mueller investigation as “partisan prosecution” and “weaponized government,” using this to justify treating the firm as a national‑security risk. ([whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/addressing-risks-from-jenner-block/?utm_source=openai))  

### 3.2 Claimed objectives

From these assertions, Trump’s official justifications for EO 14246 can be summarized as:

1. **Protecting national security and the “national interest”** by denying sensitive information and federal funds to law firms whose advocacy allegedly undermines those interests. ([whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/03/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-addresses-risks-from-jenner-block/?utm_source=openai))  
2. **Preventing taxpayer subsidization of disfavored pro bono causes**, by terminating contracts that benefit Jenner and limiting its access to federal support. ([whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/03/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-addresses-risks-from-jenner-block/?utm_source=openai))  
3. **Combating purported discrimination by law firms** (i.e., DEI programs) by tying EO 14246 to EO 14230 and presenting both as efforts to enforce civil‑rights norms rather than to attack diversity initiatives. ([whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/addressing-risks-from-jenner-block/?utm_source=openai))  

In official rhetoric, this is framed as a principled defense of national security, fiscal responsibility, and equal protection. The stated logic is that law firms whose speech and litigation positions conflict with the administration’s agenda thereby become security threats and unworthy of federal association.

---

## 4. Actual Aims and Authoritarian Function of the Order

EO 14246 is not a neutral security measure. It is an instrument of **presidential retribution** and **systemic intimidation of the legal profession**, designed to consolidate executive power by punishing lawyers who challenge the regime.

### 4.1 Direct retaliation for protected advocacy

Independent reporting and subsequent court findings show that the order’s real trigger was not any concrete security breach but:

- Jenner & Block’s **representation of clients and causes opposed by Trump’s agenda**, including litigation on transgender rights, asylum protections, and environmental regulation; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Targeting_of_law_firms_and_lawyers_under_the_second_Trump_administration?utm_source=openai))  
- The firm’s prior employment of **Andrew Weissmann**, a central figure in the Mueller investigation whom Trump has publicly vilified for years. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-law-firm-jenner-asks-court-permanently-bar-trump-executive-order-2025-04-28/?utm_source=openai))  

U.S. District Judge John D. Bates, a George W. Bush appointee, held that EO 14246 was **unconstitutional retaliation** targeting the firm “because of the causes Jenner champions, the clients Jenner represents, and a lawyer Jenner once employed.” ([cbsnews.com](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/judge-strikes-down-trump-order-targeting-law-firm-jenner-block-calling-parts-of-it-a-screed/?utm_source=openai))  

The court concluded the order engaged in **viewpoint discrimination**, forcing Jenner to “change its speech or suffer a serious injury to its livelihood” and thereby “punish[ing] and seek[ing] to silence speech” that was unfavored by the administration. ([jurist.org](https://www.jurist.org/news/2025/05/us-federal-court-permanently-blocks-executive-order-targeting-law-firm/?utm_source=openai))  

These findings shred the pretense that EO 14246 was about neutral risk management. It is reprisal for constitutionally protected advocacy.

### 4.2 Blacklisting as a tool of plutocratic entrenchment

The order’s structure weaponizes the federal government’s economic power:

- By suspending clearances and restricting access, it impairs Jenner’s ability to serve clients whose matters intersect with classified information or federal facilities. ([whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/03/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-addresses-risks-from-jenner-block/?utm_source=openai))  
- By directing agencies to terminate contracts and to avoid doing business with entities that “do business with Jenner,” it pressures government contractors to abandon the firm or risk their own federal work. ([whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/addressing-risks-from-jenner-block/?utm_source=openai))  

JURIST’s analysis underscores that roughly **40 percent of Jenner’s future income** was expected to derive from clients dependent on federal contracts, meaning EO 14246 threatened to carve away nearly half the firm’s business and brand it with a “government‑inscribed scarlet letter” in the marketplace. ([jurist.org](https://www.jurist.org/news/2025/05/us-federal-court-permanently-blocks-executive-order-targeting-law-firm/?utm_source=openai))  

This is **economic coercion**: the administration deploys state power to force private actors—contractors and law firms—into a hierarchy of loyalty, where survival depends on avoiding disfavored representation and speech.

### 4.3 Chilling pro bono and civil‑rights advocacy across “Big Law”

EO 14246 is part of a broader pattern in Trump’s second term of targeting law firms (Perkins Coie, WilmerHale, Covington & Burling, Susman Godfrey and others) with bespoke executive orders and threats of blacklisting. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-law-firm-jenner-asks-court-permanently-bar-trump-executive-order-2025-04-28/?utm_source=openai))  

The consequences already documented include:

- Multiple firms suing to block similar orders, arguing that the administration is trying to **intimidate lawyers out of representing clients who challenge Trump’s policies**; ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-law-firm-jenner-asks-court-permanently-bar-trump-executive-order-2025-04-28/?utm_source=openai))  
- At least one major firm, Skadden Arps, reportedly accepting a “deal” requiring **$100 million in pro‑Trump pro bono work and abandonment of DEI practices** to avoid being targeted by an EO. ([theguardian.com](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/28/jenner-block-wilmerhale-law-firms-sue-trump?utm_source=openai))  

This is a textbook method of **institutional erosion**: making an example of a few high‑profile targets to send a brutal message to the rest of the profession. The objective is to transform the ostensibly independent bar into a compliant adjunct of executive power.

### 4.4 Assault on separation of powers and the right to counsel

By explicitly singling out firms that represent litigants opposing the administration—and then seeking to destroy their ability to function in federal arenas—EO 14246 aims to:

- **Insulate executive policy from judicial review**, by depriving opponents of experienced counsel willing and able to take on sensitive, resource‑intensive cases; ([jurist.org](https://www.jurist.org/news/2025/05/us-federal-court-permanently-blocks-executive-order-targeting-law-firm/?utm_source=openai))  
- Threaten the **Sixth Amendment right to counsel** in contexts where security clearances and facility access are necessary for effective representation (e.g., certain national‑security prosecutions), a concern highlighted by Judge Bates and legal commentators. ([cbsnews.com](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/judge-strikes-down-trump-order-targeting-law-firm-jenner-block-calling-parts-of-it-a-screed/?utm_source=openai))  

The federal court ultimately struck down EO 14246 as “violative of the Constitution” and permanently enjoined its enforcement—but only after the administration succeeded in broadcasting its intended lesson to the entire legal market. ([cbsnews.com](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/judge-strikes-down-trump-order-targeting-law-firm-jenner-block-calling-parts-of-it-a-screed/?utm_source=openai))

## 5. Role of EO 14246 in the Broader Authoritarian Project

EO 14246 is not an aberration; it is a critical component of a **coherent authoritarian strategy** pursued in Trump’s second term.

### 5.1 From “enemy of the people” rhetoric to structural punishment

Trump’s longstanding demonization of the press, prosecutors, and judges has now been translated into **formalized machinery to punish institutional dissent**:

- Perkins Coie (EO 14230) was accused of “election‑related lawfare” and subjected to similar sanctions.  
- Jenner & Block (EO 14246) is attacked over transgender rights, immigration work, and Weissmann’s role in the Mueller investigation.  
- WilmerHale, Covington, Susman Godfrey, and others are roped into a climate of fear through additional executive orders and threats. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Targeting_of_law_firms_and_lawyers_under_the_second_Trump_administration?utm_source=openai))  

This is a **systemic dismantling** of the adversarial legal system. The administration is not merely criticizing its opponents; it is engineering a regime in which participation in that opposition can trigger professional annihilation.

### 5.2 Centralizing power through control of legal representation

An authoritarian executive benefits when:

- The pool of lawyers willing to challenge its policies shrinks under threat of sanctions;  
- Major firms recalibrate their pro bono portfolios away from civil‑rights, immigrant, LGBTQ+, voting‑rights, and environmental work and toward causes that are ideologically safe or affirmatively aligned with the regime; ([theguardian.com](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/28/jenner-block-wilmerhale-law-firms-sue-trump?utm_source=openai))  
- Access to the federal contracting and clearance ecosystem becomes contingent on political docility.

EO 14246 thus advances **plutocratic entrenchment**: corporate actors that acquiesce in the administration’s politics retain access to lucrative federal work, while those who defend vulnerable communities or investigate presidential misconduct are cast out.

### 5.3 Conditioning the professional elite to accept subjugation

The Trump administration’s broader campaign against law firms is paired with:

- Direct attacks on universities, including efforts to strip Harvard of its ability to host foreign students under SEVP; ([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/16d11962e5a039cc98ead9a9d07694de?utm_source=openai))  
- Aggressive rollbacks of civil‑rights and environmental protections, often defended by the same law firms now under threat. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Targeting_of_law_firms_and_lawyers_under_the_second_Trump_administration?utm_source=openai))  

Taken together, these moves push influential professional institutions toward a posture of **fearful compliance**. EO 14246 is one of the clearest signals that in Trump’s second term, **loyalty to the leader—not fidelity to law, evidence, or professional ethics—is the primary currency of survival.**

---

## 6. Concrete Harms and Chilling Effects

Even with the federal courts ultimately enjoining EO 14246, the order inflicts serious, lasting damage.

### 6.1 Immediate operational and economic harm to Jenner & Block

Before and during the litigation:

- The order **suspended clearances** and restricted building access, disrupting ongoing representations that depended on secure communications or facility entry. ([whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/03/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-addresses-risks-from-jenner-block/?utm_source=openai))  
- Agencies were instructed to review and begin unwinding contracts involving Jenner or its contractor clients, threatening a revenue stream that, by one estimate, accounted for **around 40 percent of the firm’s future income.** ([jurist.org](https://www.jurist.org/news/2025/05/us-federal-court-permanently-blocks-executive-order-targeting-law-firm/?utm_source=openai))  

Even though Judge Bates issued a temporary restraining order just three days after the EO and later permanently blocked it, Jenner was forced to mobilize litigation resources, reassure clients, and manage the reputational blow of being officially branded a national‑security risk. ([caselaw.findlaw.com](https://caselaw.findlaw.com/court/us-dis-crt-dis-col/117111282.html?utm_source=openai))  

### 6.2 Harm to clients and to the right to counsel

EO 14246 directly endangered the interests of Jenner’s clients:

- Federal criminal defendants, whistleblowers, asylum seekers, and other vulnerable clients could have lost counsel with the necessary clearances and federal‑facility access to handle classified or sensitive information. ([jurist.org](https://www.jurist.org/news/2025/05/us-federal-court-permanently-blocks-executive-order-targeting-law-firm/?utm_source=openai))  
- Clients dependent on government‑contract relationships faced pressure to sever ties with Jenner, not because of the quality of representation, but due to fear of collateral sanctions. ([jurist.org](https://www.jurist.org/news/2025/05/us-federal-court-permanently-blocks-executive-order-targeting-law-firm/?utm_source=openai))  

By treating a firm’s client base and pro bono docket as evidence of “risk,” the order makes **representation itself suspect**, undermining the adversarial structure on which constitutional rights depend.

### 6.3 System‑wide chilling of pro bono, civil‑rights, and impact litigation

The broader bar is already adjusting behavior:

- Reuters and other outlets report that numerous firms reassessed their pro bono portfolios after the wave of Trump orders, with some sharply curtailing work on issues like transgender rights, immigrant protections, and election law—areas specifically demonized in EO 14246’s preamble. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-law-firm-jenner-asks-court-permanently-bar-trump-executive-order-2025-04-28/?utm_source=openai))  
- The example of Skadden Arps, which allegedly agreed to massive pro‑Trump pro bono commitments and abandoned DEI initiatives to avoid being targeted, illustrates how the orders **coerce ideological alignment** in exchange for continued access to federal business. ([theguardian.com](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/28/jenner-block-wilmerhale-law-firms-sue-trump?utm_source=openai))  

This chilling effect will not vanish simply because courts invalidate particular orders. Once the profession internalizes that a president is willing to blacklist firms and destroy their federal practices over political disagreements, risk‑averse partners will quietly limit future challenges to the regime.

### 6.4 Long‑term damage to democratic infrastructure

EO 14246 fits into a pattern that weakens the institutional bulwarks of democracy:

- It attacks the **independence of the bar**, signalling that lawyers who stand between citizens and abusive state power can become targets themselves. ([jurist.org](https://www.jurist.org/news/2025/05/us-federal-court-permanently-blocks-executive-order-targeting-law-firm/?utm_source=openai))  
- It erodes **separation of powers** by attempting to starve the pool of adversarial counsel essential for meaningful judicial review of executive action. ([cbsnews.com](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/judge-strikes-down-trump-order-targeting-law-firm-jenner-block-calling-parts-of-it-a-screed/?utm_source=openai))  
- It normalizes the idea that national‑security tools (clearances, building access, contract eligibility) can be repurposed for **personal vendettas and ideological policing**, not legitimate risk management.

These harms are structural, not merely episodic. They will shape how future administrations, agencies, firms, and judges understand the permissible bounds of executive retaliation unless they are explicitly repudiated and reversed.

---

## 7. Policy Agenda to Reverse and Repair the Damage

The next administration must treat EO 14246 as a warning flare and respond with decisive, structural reforms.

### 7.1 Immediate revocation and categorical repudiation

**Action:** On Day One, issue a new executive order that:

- Revokes EO 14246 and all related orders targeting specific law firms (including EO 14230);  
- Declares as policy that lawful legal advocacy, client selection, and pro bono work **shall never be treated as a security, contracting, or hiring risk**, absent concrete evidence of crime or espionage;  
- Directs agencies and OMB to rescind all guidance issued under these orders and to notify contractors and bar associations of the change. ([whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/addressing-risks-from-jenner-block/?utm_source=openai))  

### 7.2 Statutory safeguards against viewpoint‑based contracting and clearance abuse

**Action:** Work with Congress to:

- Amend the federal procurement and security‑clearance statutes to **ban retaliatory actions based on viewpoint, client identity, or lawful litigation activity**, codifying what courts recognized in striking down EO 14246; ([jurist.org](https://www.jurist.org/news/2025/05/us-federal-court-permanently-blocks-executive-order-targeting-law-firm/?utm_source=openai))  
- Require written, reviewable justifications for any contractor‑wide restrictions on law firms, with judicial review available on an expedited basis.

### 7.3 Positive protections for the independence of the legal profession

**Action:** Advance a legislative and regulatory package that:

- Explicitly protects **pro bono and civil‑rights advocacy** from being treated as a disqualifying factor in federal hiring, contracting, or clearance determinations;  
- Encourages the Judicial Conference and state bars to adopt rules condemning and reporting any executive or agency attempts to punish firms over litigation positions;  
- Creates a small grants program to support independent, movement‑aligned legal organizations so that vulnerable communities are not left dependent on a “captured” Big Law ecosystem. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Targeting_of_law_firms_and_lawyers_under_the_second_Trump_administration?utm_source=openai))  

These steps do more than “undo” one order; they fortify the profession and the courts against future efforts—by Trump or any successor—to use executive power as a bludgeon against those who dare to litigate.
