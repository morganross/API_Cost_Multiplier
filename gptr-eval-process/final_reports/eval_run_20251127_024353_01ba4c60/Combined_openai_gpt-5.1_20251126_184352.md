## 1. Descriptive Characterization of Executive Order 14246

Executive Order 14246, “Addressing Risks from Jenner & Block,” is a bespoke presidential blacklist directed at a single private law firm, Jenner & Block LLP. In plain terms, it is a **Retaliation and Repression Directive to Blacklist Dissenting Counsel**: a draconian decree that mobilizes national‑security tools, federal contracting power, and hiring authority to punish a firm for whom it has represented, what causes it has advanced, and which lawyer—Andrew Weissmann—it welcomed back into its ranks after his role in the Mueller investigation. ([whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/addressing-risks-from-jenner-block/?utm_source=openai))  

Under the antiseptic language of “addressing risks,” the order brands Jenner & Block as a supposed national‑security and civil‑rights menace, weaponizing executive authority to starve it of federal work, choke off its access to government facilities, and intimidate any contractor that dares to continue doing business with it. ([whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/addressing-risks-from-jenner-block/?utm_source=openai))  

At its core, EO 14246 is not policy; it is punishment. It announces to the legal profession that high‑impact litigation against the regime—on behalf of immigrants, transgender people, environmental protections, and democratic accountability—will be met not with argument in court, but with economic strangulation and professional excommunication.

## 2. Operative Provisions: What Executive Order 14246 Does

Drawing from the order’s text and official White House materials, the EO imposes an integrated package of sanctions on Jenner & Block: ([whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/addressing-risks-from-jenner-block/?utm_source=openai))  

- **Immediate suspension of all Jenner‑related security clearances**  
  - The Attorney General, Director of National Intelligence, and other agency heads must “immediately” suspend any active security clearances held by Jenner attorneys and staff, pending review of whether continued access is “consistent with the national interest.”  
  - This directly cuts Jenner lawyers off from classified information in ongoing matters, including criminal, national‑security, and military‑related representations.  

- **Termination of government‑provided material, services, and secure access**  
  - The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) must identify all federal property, material, and services provided “for the benefit of Jenner,” explicitly including Sensitive Compartmented Information Facilities (SCIFs).  
  - Agencies must “expeditiously” stop providing such support and restrict Jenner employees’ access to government buildings when deemed inconsistent with national security or “interests of the United States.”  

- **Contracting crackdown and de facto blacklisting**  
  - Government contracting agencies must require federal contractors to disclose any business they conduct with Jenner and whether that business relates to the subject of the government contract.  
  - Agency heads must review all contracts with Jenner and with entities that do business with Jenner, and, to the maximum extent permitted by law, terminate any contract under which Jenner performs services.  
  - Agencies are instructed to “align their funding decisions” with Trump’s broader directive to “end the weaponization of the Federal Government,” effectively tying contract decisions to political loyalty.  

- **Restrictions on official engagement and hiring of Jenner lawyers**  
  - Agencies must limit official interactions between government employees and Jenner attorneys—including Andrew Weissmann—whenever such engagement is deemed inconsistent with national‑security or other U.S. interests.  
  - Agency officials are instructed to refrain from hiring Jenner employees absent a high‑level waiver, again singling out Weissmann by name.  

- **Integration into the anti‑DEI and anti‑“lawfare” campaign**  
  - Section 4 expressly preserves and cross‑references section 4 of Executive Order 14230, “Addressing Risks from Perkins Coie LLP,” which targets diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs and litigation disfavored by the administration. ([whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/addressing-risks-from-jenner-block/?utm_source=openai))  

- **Boilerplate implementation clause used as a fig leaf**  
  - A standard final section asserts that the EO creates no enforceable rights and must be implemented consistent with law and appropriations—language that in no way mitigates the order’s blacklist structure or its intent to coerce. ([whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/addressing-risks-from-jenner-block/?utm_source=openai))  

Collectively, these provisions function as a custom‑built sanctions regime against one firm and, by extension, a warning shot to every other major law firm in the country.

## 3. Stated Purpose and Official Justifications

**Official framing of the “problem.”**  

Section 1 of EO 14246 and the accompanying White House fact sheet present a sweeping indictment of so‑called “Big Law” firms. The administration asserts that certain firms supposedly:  

- Engage in conduct “detrimental to critical American interests,” including threats to public safety and national security;  
- “Limit constitutional freedoms,” degrade the quality of elections, and undermine “bedrock American principles”;  
- Channel “hundreds of millions” of client dollars through pro bono practices into “destructive causes” that harm their own clients. ([whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/addressing-risks-from-jenner-block/?utm_source=openai))  

Within this narrative, Jenner & Block is portrayed as a paradigmatic offender that has:  

- “Abandoned the profession’s highest ideals” by engaging in partisan “lawfare” to achieve political ends;  
- Supported “attacks against women and children” by refusing to accept “the biological reality of sex,” a smear directed at the firm’s work on transgender rights and gender‑affirming care;  
- Backed “obstruction” of efforts to prevent “illegal aliens” from committing crimes and trafficking drugs, a reference to its immigration and asylum litigation;  
- Discriminated against employees through allegedly unlawful DEI policies and “race‑based targets.” ([whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/addressing-risks-from-jenner-block/?utm_source=openai))  

The order fixates on Jenner’s decision to re‑hire Andrew Weissmann, describing him as an “unethical” architect of “weaponized government” whose work in the Mueller investigation is cast as partisan persecution of Trump rather than lawful accountability. This personal grievance is elevated into a supposed national‑security concern. ([whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/addressing-risks-from-jenner-block/?utm_source=openai))  

**Claimed objectives.**  

From these assertions, the Trump administration claims EO 14246 is necessary to:  

1. **Protect national security and the “national interest”** by denying sensitive information and secure facilities to a firm whose advocacy allegedly undermines those interests. ([whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/addressing-risks-from-jenner-block/?utm_source=openai))  
2. **Prevent taxpayer subsidization of disfavored pro bono causes** by terminating contracts that involve Jenner and by pressuring contractors that do business with the firm. ([whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/addressing-risks-from-jenner-block/?utm_source=openai))  
3. **Enforce civil‑rights norms** by recasting attacks on Jenner’s DEI efforts as enforcement of anti‑discrimination law, and by tethering the order to the earlier Perkins Coie EO. ([whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/addressing-risks-from-jenner-block/?utm_source=openai))  

Presented in official rhetoric, EO 14246 is framed as a principled safeguard of security, fiscal responsibility, and equality. In reality, these justifications are a thin veneer over naked political reprisal.

## 4. The Order’s Real Function: Retaliation and Authoritarian Control

EO 14246 is not a neutral risk‑management tool; it is a calculated act of presidential vengeance and an instrument for **systemic dismantling of independent legal advocacy**.

**Retaliation for protected advocacy and association.**  

Independent reporting and legal analysis make clear that what provoked EO 14246 was not any identifiable security breach, but Jenner & Block’s **clients, causes, and personnel**:  

- The firm’s representation of litigants challenging Trump‑aligned positions on gender‑affirming health care, asylum rights, and environmental regulation; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Targeting_of_law_firms_and_lawyers_under_the_second_Trump_administration?utm_source=openai))  
- Its association with Andrew Weissmann, a visible critic of Trump and a senior prosecutor in the Mueller investigation. ([whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/addressing-risks-from-jenner-block/?utm_source=openai))  

Judge John D. Bates of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia permanently enjoined EO 14246, holding that it violated the First Amendment because it engaged in viewpoint discrimination and retaliation. He found that the order presented Jenner with an unconstitutional choice: **change its speech and advocacy or suffer severe injury to its livelihood**, and concluded that the EO “punishes and seeks to silence speech” to insulate government laws from judicial inquiry. ([jurist.org](https://www.jurist.org/news/2025/05/us-federal-court-permanently-blocks-executive-order-targeting-law-firm/?utm_source=openai))  

This judicial finding obliterates the administration’s claimed rationale. EO 14246 is punishment for speech, client selection, and legal positions disfavored by the president.

**Blacklisting as economic coercion and plutocratic entrenchment.**  

Beyond symbolism, the EO is engineered to inflict financial ruin and market stigma:  

- Suspension of clearances and loss of SCIF access threatens Jenner’s capacity to serve clients in matters involving classified or sensitive information. ([whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/addressing-risks-from-jenner-block/?utm_source=openai))  
- The contracting provisions signal to every major federal contractor that continuing to employ Jenner risks loss of government business. JURIST notes that about **40 percent of Jenner’s future income** was projected to come from clients dependent on federal contracts, meaning the EO threatened nearly half of the firm’s revenue stream and branded it with a “government‑inscribed scarlet letter.” ([jurist.org](https://www.jurist.org/news/2025/05/us-federal-court-permanently-blocks-executive-order-targeting-law-firm/?utm_source=openai))  

This is **economic subjugation** deployed in service of political loyalty: federal dollars and access are conditioned on alignment with the president’s preferences and avoidance of “disloyal” counsel.

**Chilling legal representation and pro bono work across “Big Law.”**  

EO 14246 is one node in a larger web of executive attacks on law firms deemed hostile to Trump’s interests. Since early 2025, the administration has:  

- Issued EO 14230 against Perkins Coie, EO 14237 against Paul, Weiss, EO 14250 against WilmerHale, and EO 14263 against Susman Godfrey, all structured around suspension of clearances, building‑access bans, and aggressive contract reviews. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Targeting_of_law_firms_and_lawyers_under_the_second_Trump_administration?utm_source=openai))  
- Used presidential memoranda to target Covington & Burling and to threaten any firm accused of filing “vexatious” litigation against the administration. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Targeting_of_law_firms_and_lawyers_under_the_second_Trump_administration?utm_source=openai))  
- Accepted deals from Paul, Weiss and Skadden Arps in which the firms agreed to pour tens or hundreds of millions of dollars into projects aligned with Trump’s agenda and to abandon DEI practices, in exchange for having orders rescinded or never issued. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Targeting_of_law_firms_and_lawyers_under_the_second_Trump_administration?utm_source=openai))  

This campaign does not merely injure individual firms; it **disciplines an entire professional class**. The message is unmistakable: take on certain clients or causes—election integrity, environmental enforcement, LGBTQ+ rights, immigration, accountability for Trump—and you risk the financial destruction of your firm.

**Assault on separation of powers and the right to counsel.**  

By targeting the institutions that provide legal representation rather than the clients themselves, EO 14246 seeks to cripple the adversarial system that makes judicial review meaningful. Judge Bates emphasized that the order’s focus on pro bono and impact litigation would deter the very kind of representation that brings constitutional challenges into court, thereby insulating executive power from scrutiny. ([jurist.org](https://www.jurist.org/news/2025/05/us-federal-court-permanently-blocks-executive-order-targeting-law-firm/?utm_source=openai))  

JURIST further highlights that suspension of clearances and building access would immediately undermine Jenner’s ability to represent federal criminal defendants, whistleblowers, and others whose cases require access to classified materials or secure facilities. ([jurist.org](https://www.jurist.org/news/2025/05/us-federal-court-permanently-blocks-executive-order-targeting-law-firm/?utm_source=openai))  EO 14246 thus attacks the infrastructure of the Sixth Amendment and of civil‑rights enforcement indirectly—by strangling the lawyers instead of openly silencing the clients.

## 5. How EO 14246 Advances Trump’s Broader Authoritarian Project

EO 14246 is a cornerstone of a coherent strategy to **centralize power, neutralize institutional checks, and normalize governance by intimidation**.

**From inflammatory rhetoric to institutionalized reprisal.**  

For years, Trump described the press as “enemies of the people” and denounced prosecutors, judges, and investigators who crossed him. In his second term, that rhetoric has been translated into **formal machinery of reprisal**: executive orders, memoranda, and contracting directives aimed squarely at firms and lawyers tied to investigations of Trump or to litigation against his policies. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Targeting_of_law_firms_and_lawyers_under_the_second_Trump_administration?utm_source=openai))  

EO 14246 is part of this pattern: it punishes Jenner for representing asylum seekers, transgender clients, and environmental advocates, and for employing Weissmann, just as EO 14230 punishes Perkins Coie for its ties to Hillary Clinton and voting‑rights work, and EO 14250 punishes WilmerHale for its association with Robert Mueller. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Targeting_of_law_firms_and_lawyers_under_the_second_Trump_administration?utm_source=openai))  

**Concentrating power by constraining who will dare to challenge it.**  

An authoritarian executive benefits when it can:  

- Drive capable, well‑resourced firms away from politically sensitive pro bono and impact litigation;  
- Make access to lucrative federal work contingent on staying out of cases that threaten the president’s interests;  
- Undermine public confidence in disfavored firms by branding them as national‑security risks.  

The combined effect of EO 14246 and its siblings is to **reengineer the legal marketplace** so that the safest business decision for firms is to decline cases that might cross the regime. That is not incidental; it is the point.

**Conditioning professional elites to accept hierarchy and fear.**  

These attacks on law firms occur alongside aggressive moves against universities, civil‑rights enforcement, and environmental regulation—often the very institutions and issues Big Law has historically defended. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Targeting_of_law_firms_and_lawyers_under_the_second_Trump_administration?utm_source=openai))  The Trump administration’s strategy is to force elite institutions into a posture of anxious compliance: serve as instruments of the administration’s agenda, or be publicly humiliated and economically punished.

EO 14246 is one of the most brazen expressions of this strategy. It proclaims that the president can single out a disfavored firm, declare it a security risk based on its values and clients, and command the vast machinery of the federal state to make an example of it.

## 6. Concrete Harms to People, Institutions, and the Legal System

Even though federal courts have blocked EO 14246, the damage—material and structural—is profound.

**Direct economic and operational harm to Jenner & Block and its workers.**  

- The immediate suspension of clearances and ordered cut‑off of SCIF access threatened ongoing cases that relied on secure communications and classified information, forcing Jenner to scramble to protect client interests. ([whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/addressing-risks-from-jenner-block/?utm_source=openai))  
- Agencies were directed to review and unwind contracts involving Jenner and its contractor clients, putting at risk a revenue stream JURIST estimates at roughly 40 percent of the firm’s future income. ([jurist.org](https://www.jurist.org/news/2025/05/us-federal-court-permanently-blocks-executive-order-targeting-law-firm/?utm_source=openai))  
- Being officially branded a national‑security threat and discriminator under civil‑rights law inflicted reputational harm on hundreds of employees who had no role in the targeted representations, casting a political stigma over their careers. ([whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/addressing-risks-from-jenner-block/?utm_source=openai))  

While Judge Bates issued prompt interim relief and ultimately a permanent injunction, Jenner was forced into costly litigation and client‑management efforts simply to preserve its ability to function as a law firm. ([jurist.org](https://www.jurist.org/news/2025/05/us-federal-court-permanently-blocks-executive-order-targeting-law-firm/?utm_source=openai))  

**Harms to clients and the right to counsel.**  

EO 14246 directly jeopardized the interests of people and organizations represented by Jenner:  

- Federal criminal defendants and others in matters involving classified information could have lost counsel capable of accessing necessary materials and facilities. ([jurist.org](https://www.jurist.org/news/2025/05/us-federal-court-permanently-blocks-executive-order-targeting-law-firm/?utm_source=openai))  
- Clients dependent on government contracts—defense contractors, technology firms, nonprofits—faced intense pressure to sever ties with Jenner lest they themselves be blacklisted by association. ([jurist.org](https://www.jurist.org/news/2025/05/us-federal-court-permanently-blocks-executive-order-targeting-law-firm/?utm_source=openai))  

By treating a firm’s client list and pro bono portfolio as evidence of “risk,” the EO makes **representation itself suspicious**—undermining the bedrock principle that even the most unpopular litigants are entitled to vigorous counsel.

**Chilling effects on pro bono, civil‑rights, and impact litigation.**  

The broader legal community has already begun adjusting to the threat environment created by EO 14246 and related orders:  

- Multiple firms have sued to block these EOs, but others have quietly rebalanced their pro bono dockets away from issues explicitly demonized in the orders—transgender rights, immigrant protections, election law, and environmental enforcement—in order to avoid being targeted. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Targeting_of_law_firms_and_lawyers_under_the_second_Trump_administration?utm_source=openai))  
- The deals struck by Paul, Weiss and Skadden—trading enormous sums of pro‑Trump pro bono work and abandonment of DEI initiatives for relief from or avoidance of executive sanctions—demonstrate how the orders coerce ideological alignment in exchange for survival. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Targeting_of_law_firms_and_lawyers_under_the_second_Trump_administration?utm_source=openai))  

These chilling effects will persist long after specific orders are struck down. Once it is established that a president will personally name and cripple firms over their clients and causes, risk‑averse partners will quietly narrow the range of cases they are willing to take.

**Structural damage to democratic infrastructure.**  

Finally, EO 14246 degrades core democratic institutions in ways that cannot be measured solely in dollars:  

- It attacks the **independence of the bar**, signalling that lawyers who stand between citizens and an abusive state can be targeted as enemies of the state. ([jurist.org](https://www.jurist.org/news/2025/05/us-federal-court-permanently-blocks-executive-order-targeting-law-firm/?utm_source=openai))  
- It erodes **separation of powers**, because it is precisely the firms most willing to challenge unlawful executive action that are now singled out for destruction. ([jurist.org](https://www.jurist.org/news/2025/05/us-federal-court-permanently-blocks-executive-order-targeting-law-firm/?utm_source=openai))  
- It normalizes the diversion of national‑security tools—clearances, building access, contractor eligibility—into instruments of **personal vendetta and ideological policing**, rather than genuine risk mitigation. ([whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/addressing-risks-from-jenner-block/?utm_source=openai))  

If left uncorrected, EO 14246 will stand as a template for future presidents—of any party—to crush legal opposition through the pretextual language of “risk” and “security.”

---

## 7. Policy Program to Reverse and Repair the Damage

**1. Immediate rescission, comprehensive review, and public repudiation.**  
On day one, the next administration should revoke EO 14246 and all similar orders targeting specific law firms (including EO 14230, 14237, 14250, and 14263); direct OMB and all agencies to rescind associated guidance; and order the Department of Justice to review and report on all politically motivated actions taken against lawyers and firms during Trump’s second term. ([whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/addressing-risks-from-jenner-block/?utm_source=openai))  

**2. Legislative safeguards against viewpoint‑based contracting and clearance abuse.**  
Working with Congress, the administration should enact a statute—functionally, a Legal Profession Independence Act—explicitly prohibiting adverse contracting, clearance, or facility‑access decisions based on a firm’s clients, pro bono docket, or protected speech; requiring written, reviewable justifications for any firm‑wide restrictions; and guaranteeing expedited judicial review. ([jurist.org](https://www.jurist.org/news/2025/05/us-federal-court-permanently-blocks-executive-order-targeting-law-firm/?utm_source=openai))  

**3. Proactive protections for independent legal advocacy.**  
The Attorney General should issue binding guidance to all agencies affirming that lawful advocacy and client selection are never national‑security “risks” per se; bar retaliatory actions against lawyers; encourage bar associations and courts to report and sanction officials who attempt such retaliation; and support funding for independent civil‑rights and movement legal organizations so that vulnerable communities are not left dependent on a “captured” Big Law ecosystem. ([jurist.org](https://www.jurist.org/news/2025/05/us-federal-court-permanently-blocks-executive-order-targeting-law-firm/?utm_source=openai))
