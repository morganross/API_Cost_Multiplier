4. **What the EO Does**

EO 14259 is a brutally simple but structurally far‑reaching escalation of Trump’s second‑term tariff machine. In legal terms, it does four core things:

- **Escalates “reciprocal” tariffs on PRC goods to confiscatory levels.**  
  Building directly on EO 14257 (Trump’s “reciprocal tariff” national‑emergency order), EO 14259 amends heading 9903.01.63 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) to raise the additional duty rate on covered PRC imports from 34% to an astounding 84%. It likewise amends the associated U.S. note to lock that 84% rate into the reciprocal‑tariff architecture. ([whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/amendment-to-recipricol-tariffs-and-updated-duties-as-applied-to-low-value-imports-from-the-peoples-republic-of-china/))  

- **Supercharges duties on targeted low‑value imports from China.**  
  EO 14256 had already eliminated duty‑free de minimis treatment for specific low‑value PRC articles linked to the synthetic opioid supply chain, following EO 14195. EO 14259 then **jacks those already‑punitive tariffs skyward**, increasing the ad valorem duty on those low‑value shipments from 30% to 90%, and hiking per‑parcel charges from $25 to $75 (May 2–June 1, 2025) and from $50 to $150 thereafter. In practice, this makes low‑value parcels in the targeted categories functionally non‑economic to import. ([whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/amendment-to-recipricol-tariffs-and-updated-duties-as-applied-to-low-value-imports-from-the-peoples-republic-of-china/))  

- **Transforms emergency national‑security powers into a standing tariff law for e‑commerce.**  
  EO 14259 explicitly rests on the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), the National Emergencies Act, section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, and 3 U.S.C. § 301. It declares that PRC retaliation—a 34% tariff on U.S. goods—constitutes an “unusual and extraordinary threat” to U.S. national security and the economy, justifying further emergency modifications of the HTSUS and the low‑value tariff regime. ([whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/amendment-to-recipricol-tariffs-and-updated-duties-as-applied-to-low-value-imports-from-the-peoples-republic-of-china/))  

- **Hands sweeping implementation authority to the executive apparatus, sidelining normal rulemaking.**  
  The order directs the Secretary of Commerce, the Secretary of Homeland Security, and the U.S. Trade Representative, in consultation with a tight White House circle, to “take all necessary actions” to implement and effectuate the order—including **temporary suspension or amendment of existing regulations and Federal Register notices**—and explicitly authorizes them to “employ all powers granted to the President by IEEPA” to that end. Every executive department and agency is ordered to “take all appropriate measures within its authority” to help implement the order. ([whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/amendment-to-recipricol-tariffs-and-updated-duties-as-applied-to-low-value-imports-from-the-peoples-republic-of-china/))  

- **Locks low‑value tariffs into a broader, weaponized tariff superstructure.**  
  EO 14259 does not stand alone; it plugs into Trump’s fast‑expanding second‑term tariff edifice. That architecture includes, among other measures, a June 2025 proclamation doubling Section 232 steel and aluminum tariffs from 25% to 50%, while explicitly inviting further adjustments and HTSUS modifications via executive discretion. ([whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/06/adjusting-imports-of-aluminum-and-steel-into-the-united-states/?utm_source=openai))  EO 14259 is one cog in this interlocking system of high, discretionary levies on everything from bulk industrial inputs to the smallest consumer parcels.

---

5. **Stated Purpose & Justification**

In the official text and surrounding administration messaging, EO 14259 is framed as a sober, defensive response to Chinese aggression and de minimis “abuse”:

- **Counter‑retaliation and “reciprocity.”**  
  The order recites that after Trump’s earlier reciprocal‑tariff EO 14257, the PRC announced a 34% tariff on all U.S. goods. EO 14259 claims that raising U.S. duties on PRC imports from 34% to 84% is “necessary and appropriate” to address this “unusual and extraordinary threat” to U.S. national and economic security, thereby restoring reciprocity and reinforcing the effectiveness of the earlier action. ([whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/amendment-to-recipricol-tariffs-and-updated-duties-as-applied-to-low-value-imports-from-the-peoples-republic-of-china/))  

- **Closing the de minimis “loophole.”**  
  The order notes that, via EO 14256, Trump had already removed duty‑free de minimis treatment for certain PRC low‑value imports associated with the synthetic opioid supply chain. EO 14259 justifies its massive jump in ad valorem and per‑parcel duties as needed to prevent circumvention of the new 84% tariff—i.e., to stop importers from shifting PRC goods into small parcels to evade the heightened duties. ([whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/amendment-to-recipricol-tariffs-and-updated-duties-as-applied-to-low-value-imports-from-the-peoples-republic-of-china/))  

- **Protecting American workers and national security.**  
  In line with the administration’s broader second‑term rhetoric, the White House presents these measures as defending American manufacturing and workers from “unfair” PRC subsidies, overcapacity, and “economic aggression,” and as strengthening supply‑chain resilience in sensitive sectors (opioids precursors, electronics, consumer goods). Officials repeat familiar talking points that tariffs will fall mainly on Chinese exporters, not American consumers or small businesses—despite extensive empirical evidence from Trump’s first‑term trade war that U.S. importers and households bore nearly the full cost. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tariffs_in_the_second_Trump_administration?utm_source=openai))  

- **A technical, temporary adjustment within a lawful emergency framework.**  
  The EO emphasizes that it is implemented “consistent with applicable law” and subject to appropriations; it preserves boilerplate language about not creating enforceable rights. In other words, it dresses a radical shift in everyday trade taxation in the neutral legalese of a routine HTSUS “modification.”

On paper, then, EO 14259 is portrayed as a measured, legally grounded adjustment—aimed at unfair Chinese practices, de minimis loophole abuse, the synthetic opioid crisis, and national security. In reality, it is a brute‑force instrument of regressive extraction and executive aggrandizement.

---

6. **Nefarious Reality & True Impact**

Behind the technocratic prose and “reciprocity” branding, EO 14259 functions as a multi‑layered assault on working‑class livelihoods, democratic governance, and the very idea of rule‑bound trade policy.

### 6.1 Centralization by Decree: Turning Trade Policy into Personal Rule

EO 14259 **re‑engineers tariff policy as an extension of presidential will**:

- By invoking IEEPA and a national emergency rooted in trade deficits and foreign retaliation, Trump converts what should be **statutory tax policy**—precisely set by Congress—into a flexible, personal economic weapon. The EO authorizes key cabinet officials and the USTR to suspend or amend regulations and Federal Register notices on the fly, explicitly instructing them to deploy “all powers granted to the President by IEEPA” to implement the order. ([whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/amendment-to-recipricol-tariffs-and-updated-duties-as-applied-to-low-value-imports-from-the-peoples-republic-of-china/))  

- This executive overreach unfolds in the shadow of Trump’s February 18, 2025 EO “Ensuring Accountability for All Agencies,” which pulls nominally independent agencies under tight White House and Attorney General control and asserts the president’s primacy over their legal interpretations. Multiple analyses and news reports describe that order as a sweeping power grab that undermines agency independence and collapses internal checks. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-sued-by-democrats-seeking-control-over-federal-election-commission-2025-02-28/?utm_source=openai))  

- Combining those two moves, EO 14259 becomes a case study in **unitary‑executive domination of economic life**: the same president who now claims to be the final arbiter of law inside the executive branch also claims permanent emergency authority to tax a vast swath of everyday imports at 84% and to impose 90% + $150 per‑parcel duties on low‑value shipments.

In short, EO 14259 is not “tariff policy”; it is **taxation by national‑security fiat**, with deliberation replaced by decree.

### 6.2 Regressive Economic Extraction: A Stealth Tax on the Poor

EO 14259’s central economic reality is simple and brutal:

- **Disproportionate burden on low‑ and middle‑income households.**  
  The targeted low‑value imports—cheap clothing, household items, electronics accessories, small tools and parts—are staples of budget‑constrained families and small businesses. A 90% ad valorem duty plus up to $150 per parcel is, in effect, a **ban on affordable imports** in the affected categories.  

- **Tariffs fall on Americans, not China.**  
  Trump’s own first‑term tariff experiments demonstrated that U.S. importers and consumers absorbed nearly the full cost of those levies through higher prices; foreign exporters did not meaningfully cut prices to offset the duty. Second‑term data on average tariff rates—skyrocketing from roughly 2.5% to the high‑20s by April 2025—underscores that this is a massive new tax on domestic consumption, not an externalized cost imposed on Beijing. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tariffs_in_the_second_Trump_administration?utm_source=openai))  

- **A stealth consumption tax avoiding democratic scrutiny.**  
  Unlike an explicit sales‑tax increase, these “reciprocal” duties do not appear in budget debates or tax tables. They are buried in customs paperwork, passed quietly into prices, and **shield the administration from direct accountability** for what is, substantively, one of the most regressive tax increases in modern U.S. history.

The rhetoric of “protecting American workers” thus masks a straightforward outcome: **the poor and working class pay more so the president can theatrically posture as a trade warrior.**

### 6.3 Weaponized Tariff Architecture and Patronage

EO 14259 is also a structural upgrade to Trump’s broader tariff arsenal:

- The 84% rate for PRC imports under the reciprocal‑tariff heading and the 90% + per‑parcel taxes on low‑value shipments sit atop a second‑term tariff system that already includes 50% duties on steel and aluminum and steep new levies on autos, pharmaceuticals, and semiconductors. ([whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/06/adjusting-imports-of-aluminum-and-steel-into-the-united-states/?utm_source=openai))  The result is an intentionally **dense, overlapping web of duties** that few outside the administration and its lobbyist allies can navigate.

- This complexity is politically useful. It makes tariff relief a matter of **insider access and presidential favor**—inviting carve‑outs, waivers, and special exemptions for well‑connected industries and firms. A loyal corporation can secure relief from the 84% duty or from draconian low‑value surcharges; a disfavored one can be left to die under their weight.

- Concurrent executive actions and Project‑2025‑aligned proposals envision using tariffs and trade remedies to fund “pro‑manufacturing” grant pools and regional pet projects. While these may not appear in EO 14259’s text, the **practical coupling of tariff extraction and politicized spending** turns customs policy into a patronage pipeline: low‑income consumers’ higher prices are quietly recycled into subsidies for fossil fuels, defense contractors, and culture‑war industries aligned with the regime.

Tariffs here are not tools of rational industrial strategy; they are **tributes levied on the population to feed an authoritarian political project.**

### 6.4 Erosion of Independent Economic Governance

The legal machinery EO 14259 depends on has implications far beyond China policy:

- The February 18 “Ensuring Accountability for All Agencies” EO already drags the Federal Election Commission, SEC, FTC, and other historically independent regulators into a regime where their lawyers and staff must align legal interpretations with presidential preferences, under threat of dismissal or discipline. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-sued-by-democrats-seeking-control-over-federal-election-commission-2025-02-28/?utm_source=openai))  

- EO 14259 **leverages that captured apparatus**: Commerce, Homeland Security, USTR, and CBP are ordered to take “all necessary actions,” including temporarily suspending their own regulations. In a system where internal dissent is chilled and legal interpretation is centrally dictated, there is little to stop these agencies from stretching or contorting their authorities to serve the White House’s political and retaliatory aims.

- Courts have begun to push back against some of the most egregious second‑term tariffs—most notably the so‑called “Liberation Day” tariff package struck down by the Court of International Trade as exceeding statutory authority—but litigation is slow, fragmented, and heavily tilted in favor of a president who can constantly change the rules mid‑stream and invoke “national security” as a shield.

EO 14259 thus functions as a **proof of concept** for a broader model: the president declares an economic emergency, asserts near‑total interpretive control over agencies, and uses them to re‑write economic reality in real time.

### 6.5 Enforcement as a Tool of Intimidation

While EO 14259’s text is formalistic, its enforcement design is ripe for abuse:

- CBP is effectively ordered to stand up an enforcement regime for a flood of low‑value parcels—millions of packages per day—without commensurate resources. That inevitability breeds **arbitrary detention, inconsistent assessments, and de facto import bans via delay**. Policy is made not by transparent rules but by choke points at the ports and airports.

- Existing customs‑evasion frameworks (e.g., anti‑transshipment rules) can be applied aggressively to shippers suspected of routing PRC‑origin goods through third countries to preserve de minimis treatment. In Trump’s politicized enforcement climate, that “suspicion” is likely to be directed at immigrant‑owned trading firms, labor‑linked cooperatives, and logistics hubs in blue states.

- Combined with Trump’s broader domestic‑security agenda—expansive “domestic terrorism” designations and surveillance of protest movements—trade enforcement becomes another **lever of repression**, chilling labor organizing and political dissent in sectors dependent on cross‑border e‑commerce.

EO 14259, then, is not merely about tariffs; it is about **normalizing the use of customs enforcement as an intimidation tool**.

---

7. **Connection to Broader Agenda**

EO 14259 cannot be understood in isolation. It is a brick in a larger authoritarian edifice being constructed in real time.

### 7.1 The Tariff State as Authoritarian Infrastructure

Trump’s second‑term tariff blitz—global base tariffs, individualized “reciprocal” add‑ons, and 50% Section 232 duties—has pushed the average U.S. tariff rate to levels unseen in a century. ([whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/06/adjusting-imports-of-aluminum-and-steel-into-the-united-states/?utm_source=openai))  EO 14259 is a key module in this system:

- It **extends the reach of the tariff state down to every low‑value parcel**, transforming routine online shopping and small‑business sourcing into activities conducted at the pleasure of the president.

- Subsequent EOs (such as those in May and August 2025 that purport to “modestly” reduce reciprocal tariff rates after PRC negotiations) do not dismantle the architecture; they merely **toggle rates within a system whose legality and parameters the White House now defines**, with 84% duties and confiscatory low‑value surcharges waiting in the wings as re‑escalation threats. ([whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/11/modifying-reciprocal-tariff-rates-consistent-with-the-economic-and-trade-arrangement-between-the-united-states-and-the-peoples-republic-of-china/?utm_source=openai))  

The through‑line is clear: tariffs are being transformed from a technical policy instrument into a **permanent coercive infrastructure** for domestic and foreign control.

### 7.2 Project 2025 and the “Deconstruction” of the Administrative State

EO 14259 also sits squarely within the Project 2025 blueprint to “deconstruct the administrative state” and concentrate power in the presidency:

- Project 2025 architects have openly celebrated the Supreme Court’s dismantling of Chevron deference and pushed for a radical unitary‑executive theory under which all agency action is simply an extension of presidential will. Trump’s February 18 “Ensuring Accountability” EO operationalizes this theory by subordinating independent agencies to White House oversight and legal direction. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-sued-by-democrats-seeking-control-over-federal-election-commission-2025-02-28/?utm_source=openai))  

- EOs like 14259 then **weaponize that captured state**: they instruct agencies to suspend or amend their own regulations, re‑write tariff schedules, and deploy emergency powers in lockstep with presidential priorities, without genuine internal checks or public deliberation.

- Parallel deregulatory orders (such as EO 14219, which commands agencies to inventory and roll back “overbearing and burdensome” regulations) strip away worker, consumer, and environmental protections—while tariff orders like 14259 **construct a new, more authoritarian form of economic regulation**: targeted pain imposed by decree, rather than general protections debated in Congress.

EO 14259 is thus both product and driver of the administrative state’s deconstruction: **it tears down neutral expertise and replaces it with personalized economic command.**

### 7.3 The Security–Economic Nexus and Domestic Repression

Finally, EO 14259 plugs into a wider law‑and‑order turn:

- Trump’s new national‑security presidential memoranda on “Countering Domestic Terrorism and Organized Political Violence” frame “anti‑capitalism,” “anti‑Christianity,” and opposition to “traditional family values” as red flags for extremism. In such a framework, **economic protest against tariff‑induced hardship is easily recast as “sabotage” or “terrorism.”**

- Aggressive tariff enforcement under EO 14259—especially if focused on immigrant and left‑leaning constituencies—feeds a narrative in which those communities are not victims of policy but **vectors of lawbreaking** (through alleged customs evasion, “illicit” trade, or supposed support for hostile foreign powers).

- Together with Project‑2025‑driven politicization of DOJ and DHS, this paves the way for an integrated repression architecture where **economic distress and political dissent are mutually criminalized**, and tools like EO 14259 serve as both cause and pretext.

In sum, EO 14259 is a **strategic component of an emerging authoritarian system**: it finances the regime, disciplines domestic opponents, and normalizes emergency economic rule.

---

8. **Harm Assessment**

The damage from EO 14259 is multidimensional: economic, democratic, racial, and environmental. The following assessment synthesizes the foreseeable and already unfolding harms.

### 8.1 Economic and Class Harms

- **Regressive price shock on essentials.**  
  The goods most affected—fast fashion, school supplies, electronics accessories, cheap household basics—occupy the bottom of the price ladder. A 90% duty plus up to $150 per parcel either **eradicates these options** or forces consumers into more expensive domestic or third‑country alternatives. For families already stretched by rent and health‑care costs, this is not abstract macroeconomics; it is **empty refrigerators, unfilled prescriptions, and unpaid bills.**

- **Collapse of small import‑dependent businesses.**  
  Micro‑importers, Etsy‑style sellers, immigrant‑owned trading companies, and small retailers rely on low‑value PRC shipments to maintain razor‑thin margins. EO 14259’s tariff shock, coupled with new paperwork burdens and detention risks, **vaporizes those margins overnight**. Large incumbents can absorb price increases, hire customs specialists, and lobby for exclusions; small players cannot, accelerating consolidation and deepening corporate dominance.

- **Cascading damage to downstream manufacturing.**  
  Many U.S. manufacturers, especially in electronics, machinery, and consumer durables, depend on PRC components and sub‑assemblies that fall under the reciprocal‑tariff and de minimis crackdown. The 84% duty on covered imports and the 50% tariffs on steel and aluminum embed **multiple layers of cost and uncertainty** into their supply chains. ([whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/06/adjusting-imports-of-aluminum-and-steel-into-the-united-states/?utm_source=openai))  Production shifts, layoffs, and foregone investment become rational responses to a politically volatile tariff environment.

- **Administrative chaos and corruption risk.**  
  CBP is being asked to police an ocean of parcels with new, highly punitive rates and anti‑evasion mandates. Underfunded, pressured, and operating under politicized leadership, the agency will resort to crude heuristics and **opaque, discretionary decision‑making**—a breeding ground for favoritism, discrimination, and outright corruption.

### 8.2 Democratic and Institutional Harms

- **Destruction of trade policy as a deliberative domain.**  
  Tariffs are supposed to be negotiated (domestically and internationally), justified with data, and bounded by statute. EO 14259 instead treats them as **pure instruments of presidential power**, changeable overnight in response to tweets, perceived slights, or campaign needs. Congress is relegated to spectator status while the White House adjusts effective tax rates on tens of billions of dollars in imports.

- **Erosion of agency independence and internal rule‑of‑law.**  
  When the same president who claims authority to dictate agencies’ legal interpretations also orders them to use emergency powers to rewrite tariff and de minimis rules, institutional resistance withers. Staff are incentivized to rubber‑stamp maximalist interpretations of IEEPA and trade statutes rather than offer candid assessments. The boundary between **law and loyalty** becomes dangerously blurred. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-sued-by-democrats-seeking-control-over-federal-election-commission-2025-02-28/?utm_source=openai))  

- **Undermining of multilateral trade norms.**  
  EO 14259’s unilateral escalation in response to PRC retaliation, coupled with its explicit “reciprocal” design, **short‑circuits WTO dispute mechanisms** and invites a spiral of tit‑for‑tat retaliation. Other states take note: if the United States treats treaty‑based disciplines as optional, authoritarian governments elsewhere feel licensed to do the same, accelerating the erosion of the rules‑based international economic order.

### 8.3 Racial and Social‑Justice Harms

- **Targeted economic pain for communities of color and immigrants.**  
  Low‑income Black, Latino, and immigrant communities disproportionately rely on low‑cost imports for basic goods. Immigrant‑owned trading companies and logistics brokers are heavily involved in PRC‑linked commerce. When tariffs spike and enforcement tightens, **these communities are first in line to suffer business closures, job losses, and price hikes**, deepening racial wealth gaps.

- **Xenophobic enforcement patterns.**  
  In a political climate saturated with anti‑China rhetoric and suspicion of “foreign influence,” CBP officers and investigators are more likely to **profile Chinese‑American and other Asian‑American businesses**, as well as immigrant‑run trading networks, as potential evaders or smugglers. The legal fiction of “country of origin” becomes a vehicle for very real ethnic targeting.

- **Stigmatization of economic dissent.**  
  As households and small businesses pushed to the brink protest tariff‑induced hardship, they risk being painted as “China’s puppets” or “economic saboteurs.” Coupled with broad domestic‑terrorism narratives that pathologize “anti‑capitalist” or “anti‑American” sentiment, economic grievance can be rebranded as extremism—**delegitimizing democratic contestation over economic policy.**

### 8.4 Environmental and Global‑Justice Harms

- **Reinforcing dirty, extractive production.**  
  EO 14259 is not paired with any serious climate or labor conditionality; it simply encourages sourcing to move from PRC to other low‑standard jurisdictions or to deregulatory hotspots in the United States. Instead of seizing the moment to impose robust environmental and labor benchmarks on global supply chains, the administration has coupled its tariff offensive with **aggressive rollbacks of climate and environmental rules**, encouraging a race to the bottom.

- **Undermining climate and health cooperation with China.**  
  Escalatory reciprocal tariffs poison the broader diplomatic well just as global coordination on climate, public health, and synthetic‑opioid control is most urgently needed. Beijing predictably responds with its own tariffs and reduced cooperation; climate, pandemic readiness, and drug‑interdiction initiatives become collateral damage of a **performative trade war**.

---

9. **Reversal Strategy**

A future democratic administration will need to move rapidly and structurally to undo the damage from EO 14259 and the tariff state it anchors. Three priority tracks are essential:

1. **Immediate Legal and Policy Reversal**  
   On day one, revoke EO 14259 and its directly related low‑value PRC tariff orders; instruct Commerce, DHS/CBP, and USTR to unwind the 84% reciprocal duty and 90% + per‑parcel surcharges; restore statutory de minimis treatment under 19 U.S.C. § 1321 pending any **narrow, legislated reforms**; and publicly recommit to WTO‑consistent, allied approaches to PRC trade disputes. ([whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/amendment-to-recipricol-tariffs-and-updated-duties-as-applied-to-low-value-imports-from-the-peoples-republic-of-china/))  

2. **Rebuild Democratic Guardrails on Trade and the Administrative State**  
   Rescind the February 18 “Ensuring Accountability for All Agencies” power‑grab EO and related unitary‑executive directives; work with Congress to place strict time limits, congressional approval requirements, and distributional‑impact assessments on any use of IEEPA and Trade Act authorities for tariffs; and codify statutory protections for agency independence, including clear insulation of economic and election‑related regulators from direct White House legal direction. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-sued-by-democrats-seeking-control-over-federal-election-commission-2025-02-28/?utm_source=openai))  

3. **Construct a Pro‑Worker, Pro‑Climate Economic Order in Place of Tariff Authoritarianism**  
   Replace broad, regressive tariffs with a coherent industrial and trade strategy: targeted enforcement against forced labor and genuine IP theft; robust labor and environmental standards embedded in trade arrangements; major public investment in green manufacturing and supply‑chain resilience; aggressive antimonopoly enforcement to curb corporate price‑gouging; and creation of an independent Economic Justice Commission to evaluate and publicly report on the distributional and racial impacts of trade and regulatory policy.

Only by coupling **immediate rollback** with **deep structural reform** can a future administration not merely cancel EO 14259, but also **dismantle the authoritarian tariff state it helped entrench**.
