### The Tyranny of Terror Designations: Weaponizing National Security Against Vulnerable Populations

### What the EO Does
Executive Order 14157, signed by President Donald J. Trump on January 20, 2025, establishes a sweeping mechanism to designate international cartels and other transnational organizations as Foreign Terrorist Organizations (FTOs) or Specially Designated Global Terrorists (SDGTs). This executive fiat directs the Secretary of State, in concert with the Secretary of the Treasury, the Attorney General, the Secretary of Homeland Security, and the Director of National Intelligence, to recommend such designations. Within 14 days of the order, the Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security were mandated to prepare for the potential invocation of the Alien Enemies Act (50 U.S.C. § 21 et seq.) to expedite the removal of individuals designated under this order in relation to any "qualifying invasion or predatory incursion" against the United States.

Following this draconian order, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, on February 20, 2025, formally designated eight specific entities as both FTOs and SDGTs. These include prominent Mexican cartels such as the Sinaloa Cartel, Jalisco New Generation Cartel, Gulf Cartel, Los Zetas (now Cartel del Noreste), United Cartels, and La Nueva Familia Michoacana, alongside transnational gangs Mara Salvatrucha (MS-13) and Tren de Aragua (TdA). This designation triggers severe sanctions compliance measures, blocking designated organizations from accessing the U.S. financial system and prohibiting transactions with U.S. individuals and entities. Furthermore, the Department of Justice issued a memorandum in March 2025 prioritizing staffing in Border Districts to facilitate investigations and prosecutions, including seeking the death penalty and bringing terrorism charges against "illegal aliens who provide material support" to these newly designated FTOs and SDGTs, without requiring prior approval from Main Justice. A subsequent proclamation on March 15, 2025, saw President Trump invoke the Alien Enemies Act against Venezuela's Tren de Aragua gang, signaling a profound escalation of executive power.

### Stated Purpose & Justification
The publicly articulated purpose of Executive Order 14157 is to counter a perceived existential national security threat posed by international cartels and other transnational organizations. The administration asserts that these groups constitute a menace "beyond that posed by traditional organized crime," engaging in activities akin to "insurgency and asymmetric warfare," and infiltrating foreign governments across the Western Hemisphere. The EO claims these organizations wage "campaigns of violence and terror," destabilizing nations of national interest, flooding the United States with deadly drugs and violent criminals, and functionally controlling "nearly all illegal traffic across the southern border" through "assassination, terror, rape, and brute force". President Trump declared a national emergency under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to deal with these threats, stating the policy of the United States is to ensure the "total elimination" of their presence and ability to threaten U.S. territory, safety, and security.

### Nefarious Reality & True Impact
Beyond the thinly veiled rhetoric of national security and public safety, Executive Order 14157 represents a chilling advancement of a dictatorial agenda, meticulously designed for the systemic dismantling of legal protections and the expansion of executive power. This order, under the guise of combating crime, strategically centralizes power within the executive branch by unilaterally reclassifying criminal enterprises as foreign terrorist organizations. This maneuver dramatically expands the scope of federal authority, allowing for the application of antiterrorism laws, including the Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA), to a broad spectrum of activities and individuals that would traditionally fall under criminal justice or immigration frameworks.

The true impact is a profound institutional erosion, as it weaponizes the powerful tools of counterterrorism against often vulnerable populations and those who interact with them, even inadvertently. Legal analyses reveal that these designations elevate the risk for individuals, companies, and organizations, particularly those with business dealings or operations in Latin America, to face increased civil litigation, regulatory scrutiny, and criminal investigation and prosecution for "material support". This includes non-profits and humanitarian organizations operating in regions affected by cartel activity, exposing them to immense legal and financial peril for providing aid or services. The administration leverages this ambiguity to cow dissent and stifle aid to immigrant communities, effectively criminalizing humanitarian assistance under the pretense of national security.

The invocation of the Alien Enemies Act, a relic of wartime authority, against an organization like Tren de Aragua, underscores the administration's calculated intent to enforce suffering and circumvent established legal norms for due process. This unprecedented move allows for the summary removal of non-citizens without judicial review, shattering fundamental human rights protections. The ultimate beneficiaries are not the American people, but rather the plutocratic entrenchment of executive control, the militarization of the border, and the systematic subjugation of immigrant and marginalized communities through the deliberate erosion of rule of law.

### Connection to Broader Agenda
Executive Order 14157 is not an isolated policy; it is a critical component of the Trump administration's overarching strategy of rising fascism and authoritarian dictatorship. It seamlessly integrates with other executive actions from his second term, all designed to militarize the border, dismantle immigration protections, and expand unchecked executive authority. The simultaneous issuance of orders like "Protecting the American People Against Invasion" and "Clarifying The Military's Role In Protecting The Territorial Integrity Of The United States" illustrates a coordinated effort to frame immigration as an "invasion" and justify the deployment of military force against civilians.

This EO, by criminalizing broad swathes of transnational activity under a terrorist designation, creates a legal basis for unprecedented surveillance, detention, and deportation. It accelerates the erosion of safety nets by targeting NGOs and humanitarian groups that provide essential services to vulnerable populations, thereby exacerbating systemic suffering. The expansion of expedited removal provisions and the targeting of so-called "sanctuary" jurisdictions through threats of funding cuts and criminal penalties further demonstrate a comprehensive strategy to establish an immigration police state. The objective is clear: to eliminate any form of resistance or aid to those deemed "undesirable" by the administration, thereby solidifying its grip on power and advancing a cruel, nativist agenda.

### Harm Assessment
The tangible negative consequences of Executive Order 14157 are far-reaching and devastating, primarily harming vulnerable populations and undermining the foundational principles of a just society.

1.  **Harm to Vulnerable Populations**: By designating cartels as FTOs, the order creates a chilling effect on communities in regions where these groups operate. Individuals living under the de facto control of cartels, or those forced to interact with them for basic survival, face heightened risks of being deemed "material supporters" of terrorism, leading to potential prosecution, detention, and deportation without due process. Asylum seekers fleeing violence from these very organizations may be unjustly categorized as terrorists, thereby being denied legal protection and returned to extreme danger. The invocation of the Alien Enemies Act further legitimizes arbitrary detention and expulsion, removing critical legal safeguards for non-citizens.
2.  **Economic Inequality and Business Risk**: The broad scope of "material support" liability disproportionately impacts businesses, supply chains, and individuals operating in regions with cartel presence. Companies face increased civil litigation, regulatory, and criminal investigation risks, leading to potential monetary penalties and reputational damage for unintentional or indirect engagement with designated entities. This effectively places an impossible burden of due diligence on cross-border firms, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises, thus stifling legitimate economic activity and exacerbating economic instability in affected regions.
3.  **Loss of Rights and Due Process**: The reclassification of criminal acts as terrorism significantly expands the government's ability to bypass standard criminal justice procedures and apply more severe, often classified, counterterrorism measures. This undermines due process, limits access to legal counsel, and creates a two-tiered justice system where certain populations are subjected to a draconian framework with fewer protections. The increased discretion granted to prosecutors in Border Districts to seek the death penalty or terrorism charges without central oversight creates an environment ripe for abuse and politically motivated prosecutions.

### Reversal Strategy
1.  **Rescind EO 14157 and Related Proclamations**: Immediately rescind Executive Order 14157 and all subsequent proclamations, including those invoking the Alien Enemies Act, to dismantle the legal framework for these terror designations and restore standard criminal justice and immigration procedures.
2.  **Re-evaluate FTO/SDGT Designations**: Conduct an immediate, independent review of all FTO and SDGT designations made under EO 14157, prioritizing the removal of groups primarily engaged in criminal rather than terrorist activities, and reinstating a rigorous, non-political designation process.
3.  **Restore Due Process and Funding for Legal Aid**: Reallocate resources to strengthen due process protections for all individuals, particularly non-citizens, by expanding access to legal counsel and ending policies that criminalize humanitarian assistance or impede the work of NGOs and legal aid organizations.
