**The Authoritarian Expansion of Terror Designations**

**What the EO Does**
Executive Order (EO) titled "Designating Cartels And Other Organizations As Foreign Terrorist Organizations And Specially Designated Global Terrorists," issued on January 20, 2025, establishes a sweeping new framework for the executive branch to unilaterally label various entities as Foreign Terrorist Organizations (FTOs) or Specially Designated Global Terrorists (SDGTs). Specifically, it:

*   **Directs the Secretary of State**, in consultation with the Secretaries of the Treasury and Homeland Security, the Attorney General, and the Director of National Intelligence, to recommend designations of "international cartels" and "other organizations" as FTOs or SDGTs within 14 days of the order's issuance [1].
*   **Expands the definition of national security threats** to include "international cartels" that exhibit "convergence between themselves and a range of extra-hemispheric actors, from designated foreign-terror organizations to antagonistic foreign governments," and operate as "complex adaptive systems, characteristic of entities engaged in insurgency and asymmetric warfare" [1].
*   **Mandates a policy of "total elimination"** of these designated organizations' presence in the United States and their capacity to threaten U.S. territory, safety, and security through "extraterritorial command-and-control structures" [1].
*   **Leverages existing authorities** under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), and Executive Order 13224 to implement these designations, granting the administration immense power to freeze assets, impose sanctions, and restrict travel [1].

**Stated Purpose & Justification**
The administration publicly justifies this Executive Order as a critical measure to protect American national security and territorial integrity from the evolving threats posed by international cartels. It asserts that these organizations transcend traditional organized crime, engaging in activities akin to insurgency and asymmetric warfare, and collaborating with foreign adversaries. The stated purpose is to ensure the "total elimination" of their ability to threaten the United States, thereby safeguarding the American people [1].

**Nefarious Reality & True Impact**
Beyond the administration's disingenuous rhetoric, the "Designating Cartels And Other Organizations As Foreign Terrorist Organizations And Specially Designated Global Terrorists" EO represents a chilling expansion of executive power, a systemic dismantling of due process, and a calculated advancement of a dictatorial agenda. This order is not merely about combating drug trafficking; it is a thinly veiled instrument for the subjugation of dissent and the institutional erosion of civil liberties.

The EO's deliberately vague language, particularly the inclusion of "other organizations" alongside "cartels," grants the executive branch unchecked authority to label any group it deems politically inconvenient as a "terrorist organization." This centralization of power allows the administration to bypass traditional legal frameworks, weaponizing national security designations against a broad spectrum of entities, from political opposition groups to humanitarian organizations. The true beneficiaries are not the American people, but the plutocratic forces and ideological extremists who seek to silence dissent and consolidate authoritarian control.

Investigative journalism has already revealed the insidious trajectory of this policy. In February 2025, the State Department designated eight cartels as FTOs and SDGTs, including Tren de Aragua and MS-13, under this new framework [2]. More alarmingly, the administration has already begun to apply these designations to non-state actors far removed from traditional definitions of terrorism. In November 2025, the administration designated several European "antifa" groups as "specially designated global terrorists," further demonstrating the elastic and politically motivated application of this EO [3]. This sets a dangerous precedent, allowing the administration to unilaterally declare any group it opposes, including domestic protest movements, as a national security threat, thereby justifying surveillance, asset forfeiture, and even military action without congressional oversight or judicial review. Congressional leaders have already raised alarms, demanding transparency regarding the specific organizations designated and the criteria used, highlighting concerns about the use of military strikes against these newly defined "terrorist organizations" [4].

**Connection to Broader Agenda**
This Executive Order is a foundational pillar in the administration's overarching strategy of rising fascism and authoritarian dictatorship. By expanding the definition of "terrorism" to encompass a vast and ill-defined array of "other organizations," the administration is constructing a legal architecture for the systematic suppression of any perceived opposition. This mirrors historical patterns of authoritarian regimes that criminalize dissent by labeling political adversaries as existential threats.

This EO works in concert with other draconian measures enacted by this administration, such as the "Restoring Accountability For Career Senior Executives" EO, which undermines the independent civil service, and the "Ending the Weaponization of the Federal Government" EO, which purges federal agencies of perceived political enemies. The cumulative effect is the erosion of democratic institutions, the weakening of checks and balances, and the consolidation of unchecked executive power. This is not merely policy; it is a calculated assault on the very foundations of a free society, paving the way for systemic suffering by diverting resources from social safety nets, accelerating environmental degradation through deregulation, and enforcing a singular, oppressive ideological vision.

**Harm Assessment**
The tangible negative consequences of this EO are already manifesting and threaten to deepen the suffering of vulnerable populations, exacerbate economic inequality, and fundamentally dismantle civil liberties.

*   **Suppression of Dissent and Civil Liberties:** The expansive and ambiguous nature of "other organizations" creates a chilling effect on legitimate protest and advocacy. Any group challenging the administration's agenda, from environmental activists to civil rights organizations, could be arbitrarily designated, leading to asset freezes, travel bans, and severe legal repercussions for members and supporters. This effectively criminalizes political opposition, stifling free speech and assembly.
*   **Weaponization of National Security Tools:** The EO transforms powerful counter-terrorism tools, designed for genuine threats, into instruments of political persecution. This dilutes the efficacy of these tools against actual terrorist organizations while simultaneously subjecting innocent individuals and legitimate organizations to the severe penalties associated with terrorism designations.
*   **Erosion of Due Process and Rule of Law:** Designations under this EO can occur with minimal transparency and limited avenues for challenge, effectively denying targeted organizations and individuals their fundamental rights to due process. This undermines the rule of law and establishes a precedent for executive overreach without judicial or legislative accountability.
*   **International Isolation and Instability:** The unilateral and politically motivated designation of groups as "terrorist organizations" risks alienating international allies, undermining global counter-terrorism efforts, and potentially provoking retaliatory actions. The designation of European "antifa" groups, for instance, strains diplomatic relations and broadens the scope of conflict [3].

**Reversal Strategy**
To undo the profound damage inflicted by this authoritarian Executive Order, the next administration must undertake immediate and decisive actions:

1.  **Rescind and Replace with Narrowly Tailored Legislation:** Immediately rescind the "Designating Cartels And Other Organizations As Foreign Terrorist Organizations And Specially Designated Global Terrorists" EO. Simultaneously, work with Congress to develop narrowly tailored legislation that addresses genuine transnational criminal threats without granting the executive branch unchecked power to label political opponents as terrorists.
2.  **Establish Independent Review and Oversight:** Institute an independent, bipartisan commission to review all designations made under the rescinded EO, providing clear pathways for due process, de-listing, and redress for unjustly targeted individuals and organizations. This commission must be insulated from political pressure and report directly to Congress.
3.  **Reaffirm Constitutional Protections:** Issue a new Executive Order explicitly reaffirming the constitutional rights to free speech, assembly, and due process, and establishing strict guidelines that prevent the use of national security designations to target domestic political dissent or legitimate advocacy.
