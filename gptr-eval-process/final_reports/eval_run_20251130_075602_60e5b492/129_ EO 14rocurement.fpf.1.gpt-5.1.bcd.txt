4. **What the EO Does**  

Focusing strictly on its operative directives, EO 14275 does the following:

- **Redefines the purpose of federal procurement regulation as radical minimalism.**  
  It declares that the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) should contain *only* provisions required by statute or “essential to sound procurement,” and directs that other FAR provisions “should be removed.” ([federalregister.gov](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/04/18/2025-06839/restoring-common-sense-to-federal-procurement))  

- **Orders a 180‑day purge and rewrite of the FAR.**  
  It requires the Administrator of the Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP) (styled “Office of Federal Public Procurement Policy” in the order) and the FAR Council, working with agencies, to amend the FAR within 180 days so that it contains only statutorily required or narrowly defined “necessary” provisions. ([federalregister.gov](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/04/18/2025-06839/restoring-common-sense-to-federal-procurement))  

- **Imposes a regulatory sunset on non‑statutory rules.**  
  The order instructs OFPP and the FAR Council to (1) identify all non‑statutory FAR provisions that will be allowed to remain and (2) consider amending the FAR so that these provisions automatically *expire after four years* unless affirmatively renewed; the same sunset is to be considered for any new non‑statutory FAR provision going forward. ([federalregister.gov](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/04/18/2025-06839/restoring-common-sense-to-federal-procurement))  

- **Compels every agency to embed a deregulatory liaison.**  
  Within 15 days, each agency using the FAR must designate a senior acquisition official to work with OFPP and the FAR Council to “align” agency‑specific supplements with the EO’s deregulatory objectives and to identify provisions deemed inconsistent with the new minimalist policy. ([federalregister.gov](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/04/18/2025-06839/restoring-common-sense-to-federal-procurement))  

- **Directs OMB to issue binding implementation guidance and extend “regulatory budgeting” into procurement.**  
  Within 20 days, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), in consultation with OFPP, must issue a memorandum guiding implementation. That memo must promote “expedited and streamlined acquisitions” and apply the “ten‑for‑one” requirement from EO 14192—meaning new agency‑level requirements are conditioned on eliminating ten existing ones. ([federalregister.gov](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/04/18/2025-06839/restoring-common-sense-to-federal-procurement))  

- **Authorizes immediate use of deviations and interim guidance to bypass normal rulemaking.**  
  EO 14275 explicitly instructs OFPP and the FAR Council to issue “deviation and interim guidance” to implement its vision until final rules are published—opening the door to government‑wide “class deviations” that substitute new text for large portions of the FAR before any notice‑and‑comment rulemaking occurs. ([federalregister.gov](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/04/18/2025-06839/restoring-common-sense-to-federal-procurement))  

- **Launches the “Revolutionary FAR Overhaul” (RFO) architecture in practice.**  
  In execution, OMB and the FAR Council have created a centralized “Revolutionary FAR Overhaul” portal on Acquisition.gov, and are issuing model deviation texts to rewrite entire FAR Parts. Agencies such as HHS and GSA are adopting these via sweeping class deviations and overhauling their supplements (e.g., HHSAR) to track the new stripped‑down framework. ([hhs.gov](https://www.hhs.gov/grants-contracts/contracts/contract-policies-regulations/hhsar-overhaul/index.html))  

---

5. **Stated Purpose & Justification**  

In the administration’s own terms, EO 14275 presents itself as a technocratic efficiency measure:

- **Diagnosis of a bloated, inefficient procurement system.**  
  The order notes that the FAR has grown to more than 2,000 pages and portrays it as an “excessive and overcomplicated” framework that creates an “onerous bureaucracy.” It cites a 2024 Senate report (“Restoring Freedom’s Forge”) and the 2019 Advisory Panel on Streamlining and Codifying Acquisition Regulations as evidence that the FAR now *impedes* doing business with the government and hampers effective management of nearly $1 trillion in annual procurement spending. ([federalregister.gov](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/04/18/2025-06839/restoring-common-sense-to-federal-procurement))  

- **Promise of agility, lower costs, and a bigger industrial base.**  
  EO 14275 claims its goal is “the most agile, effective, and efficient procurement system possible,” arguing that eliminating “unnecessary” regulations will remove barriers to entry, expand the national and defense industrial base, and deliver better value for taxpayers. ([federalregister.gov](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/04/18/2025-06839/restoring-common-sense-to-federal-procurement))  

- **Extension of a broader deregulation doctrine.**  
  The order explicitly builds on EO 14192 (“Unleashing Prosperity Through Deregulation”), which established a deregulatory, “regulatory budget” posture for the executive branch. In procurement, this translates into the “ten‑for‑one” requirement and a presumption against non‑statutory regulatory text. ([federalregister.gov](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/04/18/2025-06839/restoring-common-sense-to-federal-procurement))  

- **Framing the RFO as clean‑up and modernization.**  
  Official materials from HHS, GSA, and private‑sector counsel frame the Revolutionary FAR Overhaul as a housekeeping exercise: removing duplicative or outdated clauses, simplifying structure, clarifying language, and moving detailed “how‑to” content into guidance while maintaining “essential” government‑wide standards. ([hhs.gov](https://www.hhs.gov/grants-contracts/contracts/contract-policies-regulations/hhsar-overhaul/index.html))  

Taken at face value, the administration claims that EO 14275 simply rationalizes an unwieldy rulebook to speed acquisitions, reduce costs, and foster competition.

6. **Nefarious Reality & True Impact**  

Behind the anodyne language of “common sense” and “streamlining,” EO 14275 is a structural assault on democratic control of public money. It recenters power in the hands of a small White House–appointed procurement elite, strips away enforceable public‑interest rules, and rewires the procurement system to favor the largest, best‑connected contractors.

#### a. Bypassing the Administrative Procedure Act and public participation  

The most insidious feature is *procedural*: EO 14275 explicitly green‑lights governing by “deviation and interim guidance” before any formal rulemaking. OMB’s follow‑on memo (M‑25‑25) and FAR Council guidance operationalize this as a two‑phase “deviate first, rulemake later” strategy:

- Phase I: The FAR Council posts model FAR text and redlines on the RFO portal; agencies are told to implement them almost immediately through class deviations covering *entire classes of acquisitions*—not the limited, temporary exceptions class deviations were intended for.  
- Phase II: Only later, after these deviations are entrenched as de facto law, will the Council undertake APA‑compliant notice‑and‑comment to formalize the changes.  

Advocacy analysis has documented in detail how this approach inverts the Administrative Procedure Act’s basic sequence—putting binding changes into effect *before* the public has a meaningful chance to comment, and often without any Federal Register notice at all for the deviations themselves. ([restorefairaccess.org](https://www.restorefairaccess.org/far-overhaul-watch))  

Early RFO releases go further by targeting the very sections of the FAR that guaranteed transparency and participation:

- Revised FAR Part 1 removes the prior “Public Participation” subpart and weakens controls on the use of deviations, hollowing out the internal safeguards meant to stop exactly this kind of end‑run around formal rulemaking. ([restorefairaccess.org](https://www.restorefairaccess.org/far-overhaul-watch))  

In other words, EO 14275’s first real act is to dismantle the guardrails that protected stakeholders’ ability to contest changes—*before* the real purge begins.

#### b. Substituting unenforceable “guidance” for binding rules  

The RFO architecture moves vast amounts of substantive content out of the FAR and into a thicket of non‑regulatory materials: “Strategic Acquisition Guidance” (SAG), “Practitioner Albums,” and “Buying Guides” curated by OFPP and the FAR Council. These documents explicitly disavow legal effect and are *not* intended to serve as a basis for protests or litigation. ([wiley.law](https://www.wiley.law/decoding-the-far-rewrite))  

This is a classic authoritarian move dressed up in management jargon:

- When a requirement lives in the FAR, a contractor—or an affected community—can point to a specific clause, demand compliance, and, if necessary, seek redress through GAO or the courts.  
- When the same expectation is relocated into a “guide” that “does not carry legal authority,” it becomes a suggestion. An agency can ignore it without consequence, and no one outside can compel adherence.

By relocating detail into soft law, the administration decouples procurement outcomes from any stable, enforceable standard and hands enormous discretionary power to agency officials—highly susceptible to political pressure.

#### c. Systematic dismantling of small‑business, equity, and sustainability protections  

Though EO 14275 never names them, the early RFO deviations make clear which policies are being placed on the chopping block:

- **Small business participation.**  
  RFO’s revised FAR Part 10 on market research strips out mandatory requirements to actively research small‑business capabilities and sets a new hierarchy that prioritizes existing government‑wide contracts. Analysts have correctly described this as a direct procedural attack on the “Rule of Two”—the central mechanism that triggers small‑business set‑asides when at least two capable small firms are identified. When agencies are no longer required to *look* for such firms, the trigger never fires, and set‑asides quietly evaporate. ([restorefairaccess.org](https://www.restorefairaccess.org/far-overhaul-watch))  

- **Socioeconomic, labor, and environmental clauses.**  
  Changes to FAR Part 52 have removed or weakened numerous non‑statutory clauses addressing equal employment opportunity, sustainability, and feedback from contractors, with the full redline not even made public. These are the very clauses that operationalized broad public‑policy aims—fair workplaces, greener supply chains, more accountable vendor relationships—in everyday contracts. Under the new dispensation, anything not anchored directly in statute is presumptively “non‑essential” and slotted for deletion or relegation to guidance. ([restorefairaccess.org](https://www.restorefairaccess.org/far-overhaul-watch))  

- **Emergency and defense procurement guardrails.**  
  Class deviations implementing the EO’s mandate are already rewriting FAR Parts dealing with emergency acquisitions, sealed bidding, contract types, and contract administration, emphasizing “flexibility,” higher thresholds, and “innovative” contract structures while reducing procedural detail and relocating key requirements to other parts or guidance. This is occurring through GSA and other agencies’ deviations that explicitly cite EO 14275 and the RFO initiative. ([gsa.gov](https://www.gsa.gov/policy-regulations/policy/acquisition-policy/acquisition-policy-library-and-resources/rfo202518?utm_source=openai))  

The pattern is unmistakable: rules that protect small businesses, workers, and communities are being thinned out, scattered into non‑binding documents, or erased outright—not because Congress repealed them, but because a presidential decree reclassified them as expendable.

#### d. Centralizing control over nearly $1 trillion in spending  

EO 14275’s 180‑day mandate, combined with the requirement that every agency install a deregulatory liaison and obey OMB/OFPP guidance, centralizes control over procurement regulation in the White House and a small cadre of procurement policy officials. Meanwhile, the RFO website and deviation regime effectively relocate the authoritative version of procurement rules from the public, codified FAR to an executive‑branch portal managed under presidential direction. ([hhs.gov](https://www.hhs.gov/grants-contracts/contracts/contract-policies-regulations/hhsar-overhaul/index.html))  

This is not neutral “management reform.” It is a consolidation of power over contract rules and, by extension, over who receives the government’s business. Once procedural guardrails and public‑law anchors are removed, it becomes far easier to:

- Steer large, opaque vehicles toward politically favored firms;  
- Punish contractors whose labor, environmental, or speech practices displease the administration;  
- Sideline watchdogs and litigants by depriving them of concrete regulatory hooks.

In sum, EO 14275 functions as a systemic dismantling of public, legally enforceable procurement rules and their replacement with centralized, discretionary control—a textbook move toward bureaucratic authoritarianism within the contracting system.

7. **Connection to Broader Agenda**  

EO 14275 is not an isolated curiosity; it is a pillar of the administration’s broader project to deconstruct the regulatory state and rebuild it as an instrument of presidential and corporate power.

- **Extension of deregulation-by-quota into the core machinery of the state.**  
  EO 14192’s deregulation “budget” and ten‑for‑one requirement are extended into procurement through EO 14275, turning the FAR into an object of ongoing subtraction. Instead of asking what rules are needed to protect workers, communities, or the climate, the question becomes: *What can we get away with deleting while still technically complying with statutes?* ([federalregister.gov](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/04/18/2025-06839/restoring-common-sense-to-federal-procurement))  

- **Eroding independent administration and legal constraints.**  
  By sidelining APA processes and moving substance into soft law, EO 14275 advances the longstanding Trumpist ambition to weaken independent civil‑service–driven governance and replace it with a system where loyalty and personal alignment with the president matter more than adherence to codified standards. The FAR used to embody a balance between efficiency, public policy objectives, and public trust; the EO deliberately foregrounds “efficiency” while treating those other pillars as dispensable.  

- **Undercutting social safety nets and public‑interest mandates via procurement.**  
  Much of modern U.S. social and environmental policy is implemented not only through direct regulation but also through contract conditions: living‑wage clauses, equal‑opportunity commitments, Buy American and anti‑offshoring rules, climate‑related requirements for major infrastructure and IT projects, set‑asides for disadvantaged businesses. By labeling most such provisions “non‑essential” and migrating them to non‑binding guidance, EO 14275 pre‑emptively weakens any future administration’s ability to use procurement as a lever for climate action, racial justice, or labor standards—directly serving a reactionary agenda hostile to those aims.  

- **Normalizing executive fiat over legislative policy.**  
  EO 14275 enables sweeping changes to procurement rules governing close to a trillion dollars annually, without new legislation and largely without public input. It thereby accustoms the system—agencies, contractors, Congress—to the idea that the occupant of the Oval Office can rewire enormous economic domains by decree, a hallmark of creeping authoritarian governance.  

Together with attacks on civil‑service protections, environmental and labor regulations, and voting rights, EO 14275 is best understood as another front in a coordinated offensive to weaken institutional checks and make the state an obedient vehicle for a narrow economic and ideological bloc.

8. **Harm Assessment**  

Although EO 14275 is still in its first year, the architecture it has set in motion is already inflicting concrete damage and poses grave medium‑ and long‑term risks.

#### a. Immediate harms (already observable)  

1. **Loss of transparency and legal recourse.**  
   - Agencies are issuing broad class deviations that replace entire FAR Parts (e.g., on market research, emergency acquisitions, sealed bidding, contract types, and administration) with RFO model text, often with minimal public explanation and no formal APA docket.  
   - Stakeholders attempting to understand applicable rules now must chase evolving deviation documents and non‑binding guidance scattered across Acquisition.gov, HHS, GSA, and other agency sites; many are not subject to the same archiving and comment requirements as the Federal Register. ([hhs.gov](https://www.hhs.gov/grants-contracts/contracts/contract-policies-regulations/hhsar-overhaul/index.html))  
   - Because key expectations now live in documents that “do not carry legal authority,” contractors and public‑interest groups have far weaker grounds to challenge unfair or discriminatory decisions in bid protests or court. ([wiley.law](https://www.wiley.law/decoding-the-far-rewrite))  

2. **Erosion of small‑business access, especially for disadvantaged firms.**  
   - The weakening of mandatory small‑business market research obligations in FAR Part 10, combined with guidance that prioritizes existing large contract vehicles, will predictably reduce the number of procurements set aside for small firms—including those owned by women, people of color, veterans, and firms in underserved communities that disproportionately rely on federal contracting for stable revenue. ([restorefairaccess.org](https://www.restorefairaccess.org/far-overhaul-watch))  
   - For disadvantaged businesses, the practical effect is fewer opportunities to prime contracts and greater dependence on subcontracts with major primes, where margins and bargaining power are far worse. This accelerates existing trends of consolidation and the shrinking number of distinct small‑business vendors in the federal marketplace.  

3. **Weakening of EEO, labor, and environmental protections in contracts.**  
   - With non‑statutory equal‑opportunity, sustainability, and worker‑feedback clauses removed or downgraded in Part 52, agencies now have far less consistent, enforceable language to require fair employment practices, to demand climate‑responsible performance, or to systematize engagement with workers and communities. ([restorefairaccess.org](https://www.restorefairaccess.org/far-overhaul-watch))  
   - Vulnerable workers—especially those employed by service, construction, and logistics contractors—face greater exposure to discrimination, unsafe conditions, and retaliation, because the contractual hooks that once operationalized broader civil‑rights and labor commitments are attenuated.  

4. **Risk of cronyism and corruption in emergency and defense spending.**  
   - By streamlining emergency acquisition rules (FAR Part 18) and emphasizing flexible “innovative” contracting (Part 16) while simultaneously thinning procedural guardrails and public‑participation structures, the EO creates fertile ground for sweetheart deals during crises—exactly when oversight is already strained. ([gsa.gov](https://www.gsa.gov/policy-regulations/policy/acquisition-policy/acquisition-policy-library-and-resources/rfo202518?utm_source=openai))  

#### b. Medium‑ and long‑term harms  

1. **Structural entrenchment of corporate power and inequality.**  
   Over time, a procurement regime that privileges large, government‑wide vehicles; minimizes market research for small firms; and moves pro‑equity and pro‑environment policies into non‑binding guidance will cement the dominance of large incumbents—especially in defense, IT, and health care—at the expense of local, minority‑owned, and worker‑centered enterprises. The result is deeper regional inequality and fewer pathways for marginalized communities to access stable, high‑quality jobs funded by federal dollars.  

2. **Lasting damage to democratic governance.**  
   If left in place, the RFO model will normalize governing by deviation and soft law, making it vastly easier for future presidents to rewrite crucial regulatory infrastructures without Congress and largely without the APA. Procurement is only the test case; similar logic could be spread to grants, benefits administration, and beyond. This corrodes the very idea that major policy shifts should be deliberate, transparent, and legally contestable.  

3. **Handcuffing future progressive administrations.**  
   A successor administration seeking to use procurement to accelerate decarbonization, strengthen labor standards, or close racial wealth gaps will first have to spend years reconstructing basic regulatory scaffolding that EO 14275 is now tearing down. In the meantime, damage to workers, communities, and the climate accumulates—precisely the one‑way ratchet toward deregulatory plutocracy that this order is designed to achieve.  

---

9. **Reversal Strategy**  

To undo the damage from EO 14275 and rebuild a democratic, pro‑public procurement system, the next administration should move on at least the following three fronts:

1. **Immediate Revocation and Freeze.**  
   - On day one, issue a new Executive Order expressly revoking EO 14275 (and its deregulatory parent EO 14192), directing OFPP and the FAR Council to suspend all RFO‑related class deviations, and ordering agencies to revert to the pre‑RFO FAR text and supplements pending comprehensive review. ([federalregister.gov](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/04/18/2025-06839/restoring-common-sense-to-federal-procurement))  

2. **APA‑Anchored Rebuild of the FAR With Stronger Public‑Interest Mandates.**  
   - Direct the FAR Council, via OMB guidance, to undertake a full, transparent rulemaking—through the Federal Register and 41 U.S.C. §1707—to (a) restore and strengthen public‑participation provisions and constraints on deviations; (b) re‑codify robust small‑business market‑research and Rule‑of‑Two triggers; and (c) embed explicit, enforceable clauses on equal employment, labor standards, climate and environmental stewardship, and community benefits into FAR Parts 19, 22–24, 26, 36–37, and 52. ([restorefairaccess.org](https://www.restorefairaccess.org/far-overhaul-watch))  

3. **Legislative Safeguards Against Future Autocratic Procurement Overhauls.**  
   - Work with Congress to amend core procurement statutes—especially 41 U.S.C. §1707 and related provisions—to (a) sharply limit the scope and duration of class deviations; (b) require that any major change to small‑business, labor, environmental, or transparency rules undergo formal notice‑and‑comment; (c) mandate small‑business and worker representation in the FAR Council; and (d) codify baseline social and environmental contract requirements so they cannot be erased by a single Executive Order. ([restorefairaccess.org](https://www.restorefairaccess.org/far-overhaul-watch))  

Taken together, these steps would not only reverse EO 14275’s damage but also build a more resilient, democratically governed procurement system—one less vulnerable to the next deregulatory or authoritarian administration bent on turning public contracts into a private spoils system.
