4. **What the EO Does**  

Focusing on its operative machinery, EO 14275 radically restructures how federal procurement rules are written, maintained, and dismantled:

- **Redefines the mission of the FAR as radical minimalist deregulation.**  
  The order declares that the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) should contain *only* provisions “required by statute” or “essential to sound procurement,” branding other provisions as dead weight to be removed. It casts the existing 2,000‑plus‑page FAR as an “excessive and overcomplicated” bureaucracy and uses that diagnosis to justify a sweeping purge. ([presidency.ucsb.edu](https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/executive-order-14275-restoring-common-sense-federal-procurement?utm_source=openai))  

- **Orders an accelerated 180‑day purge and rewrite of the FAR.**  
  It directs the Administrator of the Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP), working with the FAR Council and agency heads, to overhaul the FAR within 180 days so that only statutorily required or narrowly defined “necessary” provisions remain. That clock is deliberately compressed, forcing agencies into a rushed, centrally orchestrated rewrite rather than deliberative reform. ([presidency.ucsb.edu](https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/executive-order-14275-restoring-common-sense-federal-procurement?utm_source=openai))  

- **Imposes a recurring regulatory sunset on non‑statutory protections.**  
  EO 14275 instructs the FAR Council to (a) identify the non‑statutory FAR provisions that will be allowed to survive and (b) consider amending the FAR so that every such provision automatically expires four years after the new rules take effect unless it is explicitly renewed. Any new non‑statutory provision going forward is expected to carry the same four‑year fuse. ([presidency.ucsb.edu](https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/executive-order-14275-restoring-common-sense-federal-procurement?utm_source=openai))  

- **Extends “regulatory budgeting” and the ten‑for‑one constraint into procurement.**  
  The order operationalizes Trump’s earlier EO 14192 (“Unleashing Prosperity Through Deregulation”) inside procurement: it directs the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to issue an implementation memo that both promotes “expedited and streamlined acquisitions” and ties new agency‑level requirements to the ten‑for‑one mandate—ten existing requirements must be eliminated for each new one adopted. ([presidency.ucsb.edu](https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/executive-order-14275-restoring-common-sense-federal-procurement?utm_source=openai))  

- **Embeds deregulatory liaisons throughout the executive branch.**  
  Within 15 days, every department and agency that uses the FAR must designate a senior acquisition official to coordinate with OFPP and the FAR Council, identify “inconsistent” agency‑specific rules, and align all agency supplements with the EO’s minimalist policy. This creates a government‑wide enforcement network for deregulation. ([presidency.ucsb.edu](https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/executive-order-14275-restoring-common-sense-federal-procurement?utm_source=openai))  

- **Authorizes governance by class deviations and interim guidance.**  
  EO 14275 explicitly empowers OFPP and the FAR Council to implement its changes through “deviations” and interim guidance while the formal rewrite is pending. In practice, agencies such as GSA have issued broad class deviations instructing the acquisition workforce to ignore codified FAR text (for example, existing FAR part 25) and instead follow RFO model language posted on Acquisition.gov, making these deviations de facto law before any notice‑and‑comment process concludes. ([gsa.gov](https://www.gsa.gov/policy-regulations/policy/acquisition-policy/acquisition-policy-library-and-resources/rfo202525?utm_source=openai))  

- **Launches the “Revolutionary FAR Overhaul” (RFO) apparatus.**  
  The EO has spawned a centralized “Revolutionary FAR Overhaul” program: a dedicated portal on Acquisition.gov hosts model deviation texts for multiple FAR parts; agencies including HHS, DHS, and GSA issue matching class deviations to substitute these models for existing rules; and agency‑level regulations (e.g., HHSAR) are being rewritten to track the stripped‑down framework in lockstep with the RFO templates. ([hhs.gov](https://www.hhs.gov/grants-contracts/contracts/contract-policies-regulations/hhsar-class-deviation-2025-03/index.html?utm_source=openai))  

- **Establishes EO 14275 as the legal engine behind a government‑wide rewrite.**  
  The American Presidency Project records the order as signed on April 15, 2025 and published in the Federal Register on April 18, 2025, confirming its status as the operative legal authority for this “most comprehensive reform of the FAR” in four decades. ([presidency.ucsb.edu](https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/executive-order-14275-restoring-common-sense-federal-procurement?utm_source=openai))

5. **Stated Purpose & Justification**  

In its own words and in official explanatory materials, the administration frames EO 14275 as a technocratic clean‑up of a bloated system:

- **Problem framing: a swollen, inefficient rulebook.**  
  The EO asserts that the FAR has “swelled” into an overlong, excessively complex code that impedes efficient purchasing, burdens contractors, and undermines the Federal Acquisition System’s official “vision” of delivering best value while maintaining public trust and fulfilling public‑policy objectives. It cites a 2024 Senate report (“Restoring Freedom’s Forge”) and the 2019 Advisory Panel on Streamlining and Codifying Acquisition Regulations as evidence that procurement rules have become a barrier to effective management of nearly $1 trillion in annual spending. ([presidency.ucsb.edu](https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/executive-order-14275-restoring-common-sense-federal-procurement?utm_source=openai))  

- **Promised benefits: agility, lower costs, expanded industrial base.**  
  EO 14275 claims that by pruning “unnecessary” and non‑statutory provisions, the government will create “the most agile, effective, and efficient procurement system possible.” The administration argues that simpler, clearer regulations will speed awards, reduce administrative costs, encourage more firms (especially commercial vendors) to do business with the government, and thereby strengthen both the national and defense industrial base. ([presidency.ucsb.edu](https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/executive-order-14275-restoring-common-sense-federal-procurement?utm_source=openai))  

- **Regulatory minimalism presented as common sense.**  
  RFO‑branded materials from agencies describe the initiative as a modernization and plain‑language project that will eliminate duplicative or outdated text, remove language “not required by statute,” clarify remaining requirements, and “preserve essential governmentwide acquisition standards”—assuring stakeholders that only true clutter is being cut. ([dhs.gov](https://www.dhs.gov/cpo-dhs-far-overhaul-deviations?utm_source=openai))  

- **A “revolutionary” but supposedly neutral overhaul.**  
  Legal and industry commentary underscores the administration’s characterization of EO 14275 as the most sweeping FAR rewrite since its creation over 40 years ago, intended to transform an allegedly overbearing regime into a lean set of “essential” regulations while continuing to support core procurement goals. ([wiley.law](https://www.wiley.law/decoding-the-far-rewrite?utm_source=openai))  

Taken at face value, the EO presents itself as a neutral exercise in simplification: removing red tape, modernizing archaic language, and accelerating government buying in the name of taxpayers and national security.

6. **Nefarious Reality & True Impact**  

Behind the soothing rhetoric of “common sense” and “plain language,” EO 14275 is a structural attack on democratic control over nearly a trillion dollars in public spending. It dismantles enforceable public‑interest safeguards, replaces them with soft law and discretionary power, and consolidates procurement control in the hands of a small cadre of political appointees.

#### a. Bypassing the Administrative Procedure Act through “deviate‑first” governance  

The EO’s most dangerous feature is procedural. Rather than beginning with transparent, APA‑compliant rulemaking, it licenses an inverted sequence:

1. **Immediate substitution of model text via deviations.**  
   RFO model clauses and redlines are posted on Acquisition.gov; agencies are told—explicitly, in GSA’s Part 25 deviation—to follow the model language “instead of” the codified FAR part for all procurements. ([gsa.gov](https://www.gsa.gov/policy-regulations/policy/acquisition-policy/acquisition-policy-library-and-resources/rfo202525?utm_source=openai))  

2. **Only later, if ever, is formal rulemaking undertaken.**  
   Once deviations are entrenched as the operational baseline, the FAR Council may eventually promulgate formal rules. By that point, the new regime is already normalized across live contracts, and public comment is a post‑hoc formality rather than a meaningful opportunity to shape outcomes.

This “deviate now, rulemake later” method effectively sidelines the Administrative Procedure Act’s requirement that major policy changes be subject to prior notice, public participation, and reasoned explanation. Instead, entire FAR parts are being rewritten in the shadows of class deviations, then laundered into formal regulations after the fact.

#### b. Hollowing out enforceable rules and replacing them with soft law  

EO 14275’s minimalist mandate is not value‑neutral. Non‑statutory provisions in the FAR are precisely where decades of public‑interest policy have been embedded: small‑business access, labor protections, environmental standards, anti‑corruption measures, and equity‑advancing requirements.

The RFO architecture works to:

- **Strip these protections from the binding FAR text**, under the banner of removing language “not required by statute,” and  
- **Relocate detail into non‑binding guidance**—FAR “companions,” strategic acquisition guidance, buying guides, and agency manuals that typically disclaim legal force. ([wiley.law](https://www.wiley.law/decoding-the-far-rewrite?utm_source=openai))  

When a requirement lives in the FAR, contractors and affected communities can invoke it in bid protests, contract disputes, and litigation; agencies can be forced to comply. When the same principle is relegated to a “guide” that is advisory only, it becomes optional. What was once a right or obligation becomes a suggestion—subject to waiver, political pressure, or quiet neglect.

This migration from hard law to soft guidance is a classic authoritarian maneuver: it keeps just enough rhetoric about “values” and “policy goals” on paper to placate audiences, while severing those goals from any durable enforcement mechanism.

#### c. Systematic undermining of small‑business, labor, equity, and environmental protections  

Although official RFO materials insist they are merely simplifying and clarifying, the deregulatory design is transparent in several domains:

- **Small‑business and supplier diversity.**  
  RFO deviations for small‑business rules (e.g., FAR part 19) loudly proclaim that they “emphasize the importance of small businesses” while promising more intuitive, streamlined regulations. ([gsa.gov](https://www.gsa.gov/policy-regulations/policy/acquisition-policy/acquisition-policy-library-and-resources/rfo202519?utm_source=openai))  But the broader RFO instruction—to eliminate non‑statutory language and collapse detail into guidance—inevitably weakens the practical mechanisms that make supplier diversity real: mandated market research, set‑aside triggers, and specific evaluation criteria that favor small and disadvantaged firms. What remains is aspirational text about opportunity, detached from concrete procedural obligations.

- **Labor standards and workplace protections.**  
  Many existing FAR clauses that operationalize labor‑rights commitments—nondiscrimination provisions, reporting requirements, and contract‑based enforcement of wage and safety policies—rest on executive policy rather than explicit statutory commands. Under EO 14275’s hierarchy, such clauses are presumptively expendable or candidates for relegation to non‑binding guidance. That opens the door for agencies and contractors to treat worker protections as optional frills rather than enforceable conditions of doing business with the government.

- **Environmental and climate safeguards.**  
  Similar logic applies to sustainability and climate‑related requirements. Where Congress has not spelled out detailed procurement obligations in statute, those obligations survive only as long as they are encoded in binding FAR text. EO 14275 pressures the system to strip those rules out, convert them into “best practices,” and subject any new climate‑oriented clauses to the ten‑for‑one deregulatory tax—making future progress politically and administratively costly.

- **Integrity and anti‑corruption guardrails.**  
  Detailed restrictions on conflicts of interest, transparency in subcontracting, requirements for performance reporting, and other integrity‑focused provisions often go beyond bare statutory minima. As these are shortened, sunsetted, or pushed into guidance, the informational and procedural scaffolding needed to detect corruption, self‑dealing, and waste is predictably eroded.

The pattern is unmistakable: in the name of “simplicity,” EO 14275 attacks precisely those parts of the procurement regime that protect workers, marginalized communities, small businesses, and the environment—while leaving intact the core mechanisms that deliver predictable revenue streams to large, incumbent contractors.

#### d. Centralizing control over public contracts in the White House and OMB  

EO 14275 does more than delete rules; it restructures power:

- The EO vests OFPP, OMB, and the FAR Council—with leadership appointed by the President—with unprecedented, time‑compressed authority to determine which protections count as “essential.”  
- Agency‑level “deregulatory liaisons” are embedded as enforcement arms, tasked explicitly with purging rules that do not conform to the minimalist creed.  
- The RFO portal on Acquisition.gov, along with OMB memos and model deviations, has effectively displaced the Federal Register and the codified FAR as the primary source of procurement authority.

This is an institutional coup inside the machinery of government contracting. It pulls regulatory gravity toward the White House and OMB, shrinking the space for independent professional judgment and public oversight, and making it far easier to steer contracts—overtly or tacitly—toward favored firms and ideological allies.

#### e. Regulatory sunsets and the ten‑for‑one straitjacket  

Finally, EO 14275 hard‑wires deregulatory bias into the future:

- **Four‑year sunsets** guarantee that even protections that survive the initial purge must fight for their lives every presidential term. Lapses in political will, bandwidth, or attention will automatically shrink the rulebook further.  
- **The ten‑for‑one constraint** imported from EO 14192 functions as austerity for rules: each new protection must be “paid for” with a bonfire of ten existing provisions, regardless of public benefit.

Together, these design choices create a one‑way ratchet: protections can be rapidly dismantled but can only be rebuilt slowly, expensively, and precariously—if at all.

7. **Connection to Broader Agenda**  

EO 14275 is not a technocratic footnote; it is a cornerstone of Trump’s second‑term project to deconstruct the regulatory state and refashion it as a pliant instrument of presidential and corporate power.

- **Deconstructing the administrative state by executive fiat.**  
  Rather than seeking statutory changes, the administration uses executive orders to rewire massive policy domains. EO 14275, like EO 14192, is an assertion that the president can unilaterally re‑engineer regulatory infrastructures built over decades—here, the entire federal procurement regime—without fresh legislation and with minimal public input.

- **Weakening independent civil‑service governance.**  
  By governing through OMB‑driven deviations and guidance instead of durable rules, the EO marginalizes the professional acquisition workforce’s role as stewards of public‑interest constraints. Career officials are pressured to implement deregulatory templates crafted at the political center, rather than to exercise judgment within a balanced framework that includes social, environmental, and equity objectives.

- **Undercutting social and environmental policy through back doors.**  
  Much contemporary public policy—living wages, nondiscrimination, climate resilience, local economic development—is implemented through contract conditions rather than standalone statutes. EO 14275 attacks this quiet backbone of social policy: by purging or destabilizing non‑statutory clauses, it weakens Congress’s and prior administrations’ choices without ever taking responsibility for repealing them in the open.

- **Normalizing authoritarian methods.**  
  When a president can, in a single stroke, launch a “revolutionary” rewrite of the rules governing nearly $1 trillion in spending, and then implement that rewrite via internal deviations and web portals before the public can meaningfully respond, the line between democratic governance and bureaucratic authoritarianism blurs. EO 14275 habituates agencies and contractors to the idea that fundamental rules can change overnight, by decree, at the whim of the executive.

Seen in this light, EO 14275 is another front in a broader offensive: shrinking the welfare and regulatory state, eroding institutional checks, and re‑orienting the federal government around the priorities of large capital and presidential power rather than the common good.

8. **Harm Assessment**  

Though still in early implementation, the EO’s architecture, class deviations, and agency supplements are already inflicting concrete damage and planting time bombs for the future.

#### a. Immediate harms  

1. **Opacity, confusion, and loss of legal recourse.**  
   - Contractors and public‑interest advocates now confront a moving target: the operative text for many FAR parts lives in class deviations and RFO model language, rather than in the Code of Federal Regulations. GSA’s directive that its workforce follow RFO part‑25 model text “instead of” the codified FAR part is emblematic. ([gsa.gov](https://www.gsa.gov/policy-regulations/policy/acquisition-policy/acquisition-policy-library-and-resources/rfo202525?utm_source=openai))  
   - Deviations and guidance documents are scattered across agency websites and often lack the clear, centralized notice and archival requirements of the Federal Register, making it harder for small businesses, watchdogs, and affected communities to know what rules apply.  
   - Because many expectations are being shifted into non‑binding guidance, disappointed bidders, workers, and communities have fewer hard legal hooks on which to base protests and litigation, weakening accountability.

2. **Erosion of small‑business and disadvantaged‑business opportunity.**  
   - The official RFO emphasis on eliminating non‑statutory language, combined with reorganized small‑business rules, risks hollowing out the concrete steps agencies must take to discover and set aside work for small, women‑owned, minority‑owned, and veteran‑owned businesses.  
   - Class deviations encourage greater reliance on large, flexible contract vehicles and “innovative” structures that favor incumbents with significant compliance infrastructure, raising barriers to entry for new and small vendors.  
   - The resulting contraction in genuine small‑business competition will be felt most acutely in underserved regions and communities where federal contracts are a rare source of stable, middle‑class jobs.

3. **Weakening of labor, equity, and environmental standards.**  
   - As non‑statutory clauses are truncated, sunsetted, or offloaded into guidance, the contract‑based mechanisms that operationalize civil‑rights, labor‑rights, and environmental commitments lose bite.  
   - Workers on federal projects—especially in services, construction, and logistics—face a greater risk of discrimination, unsafe conditions, union‑busting, and retaliation, with fewer contractual levers to demand change.  
   - Vulnerable communities lose one of the few tools they had to push for cleaner, more resilient, and more equitable federal investments.

4. **Heightened risk of cronyism and abuse, especially in emergencies.**  
   - RFO‑driven deviations for emergency acquisitions and flexible contract types emphasize speed and “innovative” structures while cutting back on procedural detail. ([gsa.gov](https://www.gsa.gov/policy-regulations/policy/acquisition-policy/acquisition-policy-library-and-resources/rfo202518?utm_source=openai))  
   - In crisis situations—disasters, pandemics, national security emergencies—where oversight is already strained, thinner, more discretionary rules are an engraved invitation to sweetheart deals, politically connected vendors, and rampant profiteering.

#### b. Medium‑ and long‑term harms  

1. **Entrenchment of corporate dominance and economic inequality.**  
   A procurement regime that privileges large primes, streamlines away non‑statutory obligations, and destabilizes social‑policy clauses will, over time, further concentrate federal business in a shrinking circle of massive contractors. Small, local, and worker‑centered enterprises will find fewer pathways into the federal market, exacerbating regional inequality and closing off an important ladder of economic mobility for marginalized communities.

2. **Enduring damage to democratic governance.**  
   If governing by deviation, portal, and guidance instead of by stable, codified rules becomes normalized in procurement, the same logic can be exported to grants, benefits, and beyond. The cumulative effect is corrosive: major policy shifts become opaque, rapid, and effectively unreviewable; Congress’s intent is implemented or ignored at the pleasure of the executive; and the public’s ability to see, understand, and contest changes is steadily eroded.

3. **Handcuffing future progressive administrations.**  
   EO 14275 builds a deregulatory trap. Any administration that wants to use procurement as a lever for decarbonization, racial justice, worker power, or local economic development will first have to spend years reconstructing basic regulatory scaffolding just to regain the tools this order has stripped away. During that reconstruction, communities continue to absorb environmental damage, workplace exploitation, and lost opportunities—exactly the one‑way deregulatory ratchet this EO is designed to lock in.

---

9. **Reversal Strategy**  

To undo the damage of EO 14275 and rebuild a democratic, pro‑public procurement system, the next administration should move immediately on three fronts:

1. **Immediate Revocation and Freeze.**  
   On day one, issue a new executive order expressly revoking EO 14275 (and its deregulatory parent EO 14192), directing OFPP and the FAR Council to suspend all RFO‑related class deviations, and ordering agencies to revert to the pre‑RFO FAR text and agency supplements as an interim baseline pending comprehensive review. ([presidency.ucsb.edu](https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/executive-order-14275-restoring-common-sense-federal-procurement?utm_source=openai))  

2. **APA‑Anchored Rebuild of the FAR with Strong Public‑Interest Mandates.**  
   Direct the FAR Council, via a transparent OMB policy, to launch full notice‑and‑comment rulemaking that: (a) restores robust public‑participation and transparency provisions; (b) re‑codifies and strengthens small‑business and disadvantaged‑business access mechanisms; and (c) embeds explicit, enforceable clauses on labor standards, civil‑rights, climate and environmental stewardship, and community benefits across relevant FAR parts—drawing on independent legal analyses that already catalog the damage inflicted by the EO and the RFO. ([wiley.law](https://www.wiley.law/decoding-the-far-rewrite?utm_source=openai))  

3. **Legislative Guardrails Against Future Autocratic Overhauls.**  
   Work with Congress to amend core procurement statutes (including the provisions governing FAR issuance and deviations) to: (a) sharply limit the scope and duration of class deviations; (b) require that any major change to small‑business, labor, environmental, equity, or transparency rules undergo formal rulemaking; and (c) codify baseline social, labor, and climate‑related requirements in statute so they cannot be erased by executive whim. Parallel reforms should mandate meaningful representation of workers, small businesses, and impacted communities in advisory structures around the FAR Council.

Taken together, these steps would not only reverse EO 14275’s damage but also build a more resilient procurement architecture—one that treats nearly a trillion dollars in annual federal spending as a lever for justice and shared prosperity, not as a spoils system for plutocrats and presidential loyalists.
