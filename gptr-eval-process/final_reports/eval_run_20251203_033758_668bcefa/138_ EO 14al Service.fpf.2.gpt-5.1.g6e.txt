3. **[Descriptive Title]**

**“Engineering Permanent Probation: Converting the Civil Service into a Disposable, Politicized Precariat”**

EO 14284 is best understood as a structural assault on the remaining job security of federal workers, converting the probationary period from a limited evaluation phase into a standing mechanism for mass purges and ideological discipline.

---

4. **What the EO Does**

Factual directives, with the underlying reality emphasized but not exaggerated:

- **Creates a new Civil Service Rule XI (“Part 11—Probationary and Trial Periods”)** covering probationary periods in the competitive service and trial periods in the excepted service (excluding SES), and makes this new rule the primary authority over how new federal hires gain or lose tenure in the civil service. ([whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/strengthening-probationary-periods-in-the-federal-service/?utm_source=openai))  

- **Repeals Civil Service Rule 2.4 and supersedes existing OPM regulations at 5 C.F.R. part 315, subpart H**, explicitly rendering those regulations “inoperative and without effect” and directing OPM to rescind them and issue conforming amendments. ([whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/strengthening-probationary-periods-in-the-federal-service/?utm_source=openai))  

- **Flips the default from retention to termination at the end of probation/trial:**
  - Under new Rule 11.5(a), a probationary or trial employee’s federal service *automatically terminates* before the end of their last tour of duty in the period **unless** the agency formally certifies—within 30 days of that date—that finalizing the appointment “advances the public interest.” ([whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/strengthening-probationary-periods-in-the-federal-service/?utm_source=openai))  

- **Shifts the burden of justification onto the worker:**
  - Rule 11.5(c) states that the employee “bears the burden of demonstrating” why continuing their employment and finalizing their appointment is in the public interest—an almost complete inversion of ordinary due-process logic in employment. ([whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/strengthening-probationary-periods-in-the-federal-service/?utm_source=openai))  

- **Grants agency heads “sole and exclusive discretion” over conversion decisions:**
  - Rule 11.5(d) explicitly frames the decision whether to finalize an appointment as resting in the “sole and exclusive discretion” of the agency head or designee, who may consider broad, vague criteria like “needs and interests of the agency,” “organizational goals,” and “efficiency of the service,” beyond objective job performance. ([whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/strengthening-probationary-periods-in-the-federal-service/?utm_source=openai))  

- **Constricts appeal rights for those terminated during probation/trial:**
  - Rule 11.6 authorizes the OPM Director to set limited circumstances and procedures for appeals, and declares that such OPM-designed appeals “shall be the sole and exclusive means” of appealing terminations during probationary or trial periods (aside from rights required by other law, e.g., discrimination claims). ([whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/strengthening-probationary-periods-in-the-federal-service/?utm_source=openai))  

- **Imposes an aggressive, centrally driven review process for all current probationers:**
  - Within 15 days of the EO, each agency must identify every employee whose initial probationary or trial period ends 90+ days out, and designate specific officials responsible for evaluating whether those employees remain in the public interest.  
  - At least 60 days before the period ends, these designees must meet with each probationer to discuss performance and whether their continued employment should be certified.  
  - Within 30 days of the end of each period, the agency head or designee must decide whether to finalize or terminate the appointment; no conversion can occur without a written certification that the worker’s continued employment “will advance the public interest.” ([whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/strengthening-probationary-periods-in-the-federal-service/?utm_source=openai))  

- **Directs OPM to implement the EO through binding regulations:**
  - EO 14284 orders OPM to rescind subpart H of 5 C.F.R. part 315 and issue new regulations. OPM’s June 24, 2025 final rule, also titled *Strengthening Probationary Periods in the Federal Service*, does exactly this—removing previous safeguards and aligning the CFR with the EO’s presumption that probationers must be affirmatively approved to remain. ([regulations.justia.com](https://regulations.justia.com/regulations/fedreg/2025/06/24/2025-11576.html?utm_source=openai))  

- **Drives agency-level implementation policies:**
  - Agencies like the Department of the Interior have already issued department-wide bulletins (e.g., DOI PB 25‑04) rewriting their internal rules on probationary and trial periods “consistent with EO 14284 and Civil Service Rule Part 11,” signaling that this structure will quickly pervade day‑to‑day personnel decisions. ([doi.gov](https://www.doi.gov/document-library/human-resources-policy/pb-25-04-strengthening-probationary-and-trial-periods?utm_source=openai))  

---

5. **Stated Purpose & Justification**

In official rhetoric, the EO is framed as a technocratic tweak to improve performance and accountability:

- **High-performance, “no larger than necessary” workforce.**  
  Section 1 of the EO declares that “the American people deserve a Federal workforce that is high-quality, efficient, dedicated to the public interest, and no larger than necessary,” and presents probationary and trial periods as a “critical tool” for screening out unfit hires before they gain tenure. ([whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/strengthening-probationary-periods-in-the-federal-service/?utm_source=openai))  

- **Fixing alleged underuse of probationary firings.**  
  The EO cites Government Accountability Office findings that agencies have not used probationary periods “as effectively as they could” to remove employees whose continued employment is “not in the public interest,” leading to underperformers being “retained and given tenure.” ([whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/strengthening-probationary-periods-in-the-federal-service/?utm_source=openai))  

- **Invoking Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) recommendations.**  
  The order leans heavily on a 2005 MSPB report recommending that probationers should not become tenured “in the absence of agency action,” and that absent a positive decision the probationer’s employment should automatically end. The EO casts its inversion of the default (from retention to separation) as a “commonsense” implementation of this recommendation. ([whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/strengthening-probationary-periods-in-the-federal-service/?utm_source=openai))  

- **Removing “unnecessary obstacles” to terminating probationers.**  
  OPM’s implementing rule repeats the talking point that prior regulations had imposed “inappropriate regulatory barriers” to using probationary periods as an “extension of the examining process” and that it is “inappropriate to restrict an agency’s authority to separate an employee who does not perform acceptably” during this period. ([regulations.justia.com](https://regulations.justia.com/regulations/fedreg/2025/06/24/2025-11576.html?utm_source=openai))  

- **White House messaging: accountability and “draining the swamp.”**  
  The White House fact sheet pitches the EO as “enhancing federal workforce accountability,” “ensuring a high-quality federal workforce,” and “draining the swamp,” describing probationary strengthening as a way to prevent taxpayers from being “burdened by an oversized, unaccountable federal bureaucracy” and explicitly celebrating the ease of terminating probationary employees. ([whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/04/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-strengthens-probationary-periods-to-improve-the-federal-service/?utm_source=openai))  

In the administration’s narrative, EO 14284 simply enforces merit, neutral efficiency, and congressional intent, while modestly tightening an allegedly lax system.

---

6. **Nefarious Reality & True Impact**

Beneath the bureaucratic language, EO 14284 is a structural weapon aimed at converting a merit-based civil service into a perpetually precarious, politicized workforce.

**a. Default termination = permanent precarity**

- **Reversing the presumption.**  
  Historically, probationary status, while already weakly protected, functioned as a time-limited trial after which conversion to career status was routine unless the agency acted. EO 14284 flips this: unless managers actively and on time certify each individual, that worker is automatically separated. This “automatic termination absent certification” is not an incidental drafting choice; it is the core mechanism of the order. ([whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/strengthening-probationary-periods-in-the-federal-service/?utm_source=openai))  

- **Administrative inertia becomes a firing tool.**  
  Federal managers are already overloaded; requiring individualized written certifications for every probationer creates an enormous paperwork burden. In practice, missed deadlines, risk-averse managers, and vague standards ensure that many probationary employees will simply time out and be terminated—not because of poor performance, but because the process is designed to make retention the exception, not the rule.

**b. Shifting the burden of proof onto workers**

- **“Public interest” as a one-sided loyalty test.**  
  Rule 11.5(c) uniquely burdens employees to prove that their own continued employment is in the “public interest.” Because “public interest,” “organizational goals,” and “needs of the agency” are undefined, this language gives broad cover for politically or ideologically motivated non-renewals, while presenting them as neutral, discretionary judgments.

- **Near-total managerial discretion with minimal appeal.**  
  The EO and OPM rule emphasize that the agency head or designee exercises “sole and exclusive discretion,” and appeals for probationers will exist only if and to the extent OPM creates them—and those appeal procedures will be the “sole and exclusive means” of challenging a termination. ([whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/strengthening-probationary-periods-in-the-federal-service/?utm_source=openai)) In a context where probationers already lack most appeal rights, outside of limited discrimination claims, this discretion amounts to quasi–at-will employment for a massive slice of the federal workforce. ([opb.org](https://www.opb.org/article/2025/02/15/what-is-a-probationary-employee-trump-cuts-target-new-federal-workers/?utm_source=openai))  

**c. Mass-purge infrastructure for DOGE and Trump allies**

- **Probationers are the soft underbelly of the workforce.**  
  As of March 2024, about 220,000 federal employees had less than one year of service and another ~288,000 had one to two years—hundreds of thousands operating under probation-like conditions at any time. Independent estimates from the Partnership for Public Service suggest roughly 250,000 workers are in their probationary period at a given moment, about 11% of the civilian workforce. ([ourpublicservice.org](https://ourpublicservice.org/blog/federal-employee-probationary-period-rights-federal-employee-explainer-series-webinar/?utm_source=openai))  

- **OPM already demanded agencies “justify keeping” probationers.**  
  Before EO 14284 was even signed, OPM—under Trump appointees—ordered agencies to produce lists of probationary employees and explain in as little as 200 characters why each should be retained, a move longtime officials described as unprecedented in decades of service. ([federalnewsnetwork.com](https://federalnewsnetwork.com/workforce/2025/02/opm-asks-agencies-to-justify-keeping-probationary-employees/?utm_source=openai))  

- **2025 mass firings show how the architecture is used.**  
  In early 2025, the Trump administration, working closely with the Musk‑run “Department of Government Efficiency” (DOGE), initiated mass layoffs focused almost exclusively on probationary employees:
  - The Pentagon alone began cutting about 5,400 probationary civilian workers, with plans for wider reductions. ([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/31e3ed62f5f35a5e5a4a07fd8708232f?utm_source=openai))  
  - Across the government, roughly 25,000 probationary federal workers were terminated in the first 100 days of the new term before courts intervened, hitting Treasury (especially IRS), Agriculture, HHS, VA, Interior and others. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/legal/trump-administration-reinstating-24500-fired-workers-after-court-order-2025-03-18/?utm_source=openai))  
  - News reporting repeatedly describes these employees as having few rights and little to no appeal, making them the easiest targets for cuts. ([opb.org](https://www.opb.org/article/2025/02/15/what-is-a-probationary-employee-trump-cuts-target-new-federal-workers/?utm_source=openai))  

EO 14284 does not order specific firings, but it **retrofittingly legalizes and normalizes this purge logic**: it transforms the mass culling of probationary staff from an extraordinary, litigated event into the natural, default outcome unless managers jump through administrative hoops to save each individual.

**d. Chilling effect and self-censorship**

When continuation of employment requires an affirmative, discretionary political bureaucracy to vouch that you advance the “public interest,” and when thousands of colleagues are summarily fired under a DOGE‑driven cost‑cutting crusade, rational employees will:

- Avoid whistleblowing, dissent, or criticism of leadership, for fear of being deemed misaligned with “organizational goals.”
- Shun controversial work (e.g., civil rights enforcement, climate regulation, pandemic response, reproductive health) that might trigger ideological hostility.
- Seek exit from public service altogether, undermining recruitment and retention precisely where the government needs expertise most.

This is **systemic intimidation by design**, cloaked in the language of “accountability.”

---

7. **Connection to Broader Agenda**

EO 14284 is not an isolated tweak; it is a keystone in a long-running project to dismantle a neutral civil service and replace it with a politically obedient apparatus.

**a. Continuation and deepening of Schedule F / “Policy/Career”**

- In 2020, Trump’s EO 13957 (“Schedule F”) sought to move tens of thousands of policy-influencing positions into a new excepted service category stripped of competitive hiring rules and core due-process protections, including the right to appeal removals—raising alarms about a return to a patronage “spoils system.” ([gao.gov](https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-22-105504?utm_source=openai))  
- Biden revoked Schedule F in January 2021, but on his first day of his second term (January 20, 2025), Trump reinstated and amended it as a “Policy/Career” schedule, explicitly reintroducing a category of positions largely exempt from notice and appeal rights, with OPM guidance urging agencies to reclassify policy roles into this vulnerable bucket. ([congress.gov](https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/LSB11262?utm_source=openai))  

EO 14284 complements this by ensuring that **the pipeline of workers feeding into those policy roles is itself insecure and easily culled**, extending vulnerability from high-level policy jobs down through rank-and-file new hires and transferees.

**b. Alignment with Project 2025’s authoritarian blueprint**

Heritage’s “Project 2025” blueprint openly calls for replacing merit-based civil service workers with ideologically aligned loyalists, seizing partisan control of agencies like DOJ, FBI, Commerce, and FTC, dismantling entire departments, and rolling back environmental, social, and civil rights protections. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_2025?utm_source=openai))  

Former Project 2025 director Paul Dans has already praised Trump’s second-term actions—including deep staff cuts and dismantling of DEI and climate initiatives—as going “way beyond my wildest dreams,” explicitly linking current policy to the Project’s agenda of overturning progressive governance structures. ([theguardian.com](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/17/trump-administration-project-2025?utm_source=openai))  

In this context:

- **Schedule Policy/Career** strips due process from key policy positions.  
- **EO 14284** destabilizes the broader workforce and makes probation a standing threat.  
- **DOGE‑driven mass layoffs** operationalize the threat via high-volume purges of the least protected workers.

Together, these moves are textbook instruments of what comparative politics identifies as **authoritarian consolidation**: politicizing the bureaucracy, weakening independent expertise, and weaponizing job insecurity to enforce loyalty.

**c. Centralization of power and erosion of checks**

The civil service, in U.S. constitutional practice, has functioned as a soft but vital check on executive overreach—providing continuity, technical expertise, and a measure of professional ethics that can slow or deter unlawful or disastrous directives.

By:

- concentrating hiring and firing discretion in politically appointed agency heads,
- removing practical appeal routes,
- and ensuring that a large fraction of the workforce lives in a constant state of probationary exposure,

EO 14284 advances a **de facto personalization of state power**, subordinating professional standards and public law to the whims of a single administration’s agenda.

---

8. **Harm Assessment**

The harms of EO 14284 are already visible, and if left in place they will compound over time.

**a. Immediate and ongoing workforce damage**

- **Scale of vulnerability.**  
  Roughly 220,000 federal employees with less than one year of service and nearly 300,000 with one to two years of service are in a probation-like status at any given time; estimates place ~250,000 formally in probation, disproportionately young and newer hires. ([ourpublicservice.org](https://ourpublicservice.org/blog/federal-employee-probationary-period-rights-federal-employee-explainer-series-webinar/?utm_source=openai))  
- **Mass firings as proof of concept.**  
  Within months of Trump’s return, about 25,000 probationary employees were terminated government‑wide before two federal judges ordered reinstatements, finding that the mass firings violated federal Reduction-in-Force procedures and were centrally coordinated through OPM and DOGE despite official denials. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/legal/trump-administration-reinstating-24500-fired-workers-after-court-order-2025-03-18/?utm_source=openai))  
- **Sectoral damage.**  
  Layoffs hit agencies across the social state: IRS revenue agents and customer-service staff, VA medical researchers (including those working on cancer, opioid addiction, and burn-pit exposure), Education Department specialists in civil rights and special education, NOAA scientists, and more—directly degrading capacity for tax enforcement, veterans’ care, public health, and environmental monitoring. ([cbsnews.com](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/federal-layoffs-probationary-workers-warnings-bigger-cuts-on-way/?utm_source=openai))  

EO 14284 entrenches the legal machinery for making such purges routine, both by normalizing default separation at probation’s end and by formalizing a mass review-and-certify process that can be dialed up whenever the White House wants a cull.

**b. Long-term institutional erosion**

- **Loss of expertise and continuity.**  
  High churn among probationers means the government loses the very people it has just invested in recruiting and training—especially in specialized fields like cybersecurity, health care, and climate science, where agencies aggressively hired late in the Biden administration. ([seattletimes.com](https://www.seattletimes.com/explore/careers/why-probationary-employees-are-a-target-in-federal-job-cuts/?utm_source=openai))  
- **Deterrent to talent.**  
  Public reporting and leaked data about mass probationary firings—and now the codification of default termination in EO 14284—signal to prospective hires that federal employment is precarious and subject to political winds. This is especially damaging for early-career workers and those from historically marginalized communities, who are overrepresented among probationaries and already face barriers to public-sector careers.

**c. Inequality and targeted harm to vulnerable populations**

- **Disproportionate impact on younger, lower-income, and diverse workers.**  
  Analyses show that probationary workers are disproportionately under 30 and clustered in front-line, lower- or mid‑wage roles. When thousands of these positions are eliminated, it acts as a de facto youth and diversity purge from the federal ranks, reversing modest gains in representation and undermining DEI efforts even where they technically remain legal. ([seattletimes.com](https://www.seattletimes.com/explore/careers/why-probationary-employees-are-a-target-in-federal-job-cuts/?utm_source=openai))  
- **Spillover to communities.**  
  The elimination of probationary staff in agencies like the VA, USDA, Education, and HHS translates into longer wait times for veterans, fewer inspectors in rural communities, reduced enforcement of special education rights, and slower responses to public health threats. Cuts at Treasury/IRS help high-income tax evaders while straining services for ordinary filers. ([businessinsider.com](https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-musk-doge-terminations-reinstatements-legal-battle-maryland-2025-3?utm_source=openai))  

**d. Democratic backsliding through fear and politicization**

- **Loyalty over legality.**  
  When both policy-making and rank-and-file roles are easily purgeable, the rational strategy for employees is to prioritize the perceived wishes of political masters over the letter and spirit of the law. Combined with the “Policy/Career” schedule’s relaxation of due process at upper levels, EO 14284 deepens a climate where refusal to carry out dubious directives may simply result in silent non-renewal at probation’s end. ([congress.gov](https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/LSB11262?utm_source=openai))  

The result is not merely “lean government,” but a **subjugated bureaucracy**—a key step toward illiberal governance.

---

9. **Reversal Strategy**

Three concrete moves for a future democratic administration seeking to undo this damage:

1. **Immediate rescission and regulatory restoration.**  
   - Issue a new executive order on Day One rescinding EO 14284 in full; direct OPM to reinstate or redesign 5 C.F.R. part 315, subpart H, restoring the prior presumption that probationers convert absent documented performance or conduct issues, and explicitly reject default‑termination schemes. As precedent, mirror Biden’s 2021 EO 14003 repealing Schedule F and the subsequent OPM rulemakings that re‑strengthened civil service protections. ([gao.gov](https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-22-105504?utm_source=openai))  

2. **Statutory floor for probationary rights and anti–Schedule F safeguards.**  
   - Work with Congress to codify into Title 5 that: (a) probationary conversion is automatic absent a written, performance‑based justification for removal; (b) probationers have baseline notice and limited appeal rights; and (c) any future attempt to create Schedule‑F‑ or Policy/Career‑style excepted categories or default‑termination regimes is statutorily prohibited, building on legislative efforts like S.4907 (116th Congress) to nullify EO 13957. ([congress.gov](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/senate-bill/4907?utm_source=openai))  

3. **Rebuild a protected, professional civil service culture from day one.**  
   - Direct OPM to issue pro-worker guidance and training to agencies on using probation to mentor—not terrorize—new employees, incorporating best practices from neutral institutions like GAO and the Partnership for Public Service (clear performance standards, documented feedback, and explicit insulation from political or ideological tests). Pair this with guaranteed union access and whistleblower protections for probationary staff, ensuring they can report wrongdoing without fear that quiet non-renewal will be used as reprisal. ([gao.gov](https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-22-105504?utm_source=openai))  

Taken together, these steps would not only neutralize EO 14284, but also help build a **positive, statutorily anchored model of probation**—one that screens out genuine poor performers without serving as a blunt instrument of authoritarian workforce control.
