Trump issued an Executive Order (EO) that signifies a chilling and unprecedented escalation in his administration's systemic campaign against political opposition. This Executive Order, titled \"Designating Antifa as a Domestic Terrorist Organization,\" directly mandates several draconian directives:\n\n*   **Formal Designation of \"Antifa\" as a Domestic Terrorist Organization**: The EO officially labels \"Antifa\" as a \"domestic terrorist organization,\" a classification deemed legally absurd and unprecedented for a decentralized, anti-fascist ideological movement rather than a cohesive, hierarchical group.\n*   **Unleashing Federal Agencies Against Dissent**: It commands \"all relevant executive departments and agencies\" to deploy \"all applicable authorities\" to \"investigate, disrupt, and dismantle any and all illegal operations\" conducted by \"Antifa or any person claiming to act on behalf of Antifa\". This broad directive empowers the federal apparatus to target perceived opponents.\n*   **Targeting Funding and Support Networks**: The order explicitly calls for \"necessary investigatory and prosecutorial actions against those who fund such operations,\" casting an alarmingly wide net over individuals and organizations deemed to offer \"material support\" to any \"Antifa-affiliated\" activities.\n\n### Stated Purpose & Justification\nThe administration publicly justifies this egregious measure by asserting that \"Antifa is a militarist, anarchist enterprise that explicitly calls for the overthrow of the United States Government, law enforcement authorities, and our system of law—using illegal means, including violence and terrorism, to accomplish these goals\". The White House fact sheet accompanying the EO claims that Antifa engages in \"coordinated efforts to obstruct enforcement of Federal laws, with the goal of achieving policy objectives by coercion and intimidation – this is domestic terrorism\". It cites instances of alleged armed standoffs, organized riots, assaults on law enforcement, and doxing of political figures, including the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, as evidence of a \"trend of Radical Left violence\". The stated purpose is to protect the rule of law, ensure public safety, and dismantle what it characterizes as a violent threat to the nation's constitutional order.\n\n### Nefarious Reality & True Impact\nBeyond the administration's disingenuous rhetoric, the \"Executive Order on Designating Antifa as a Domestic Terrorist Organization\" is a calculated maneuver to centralize authoritarian power, weaken democratic institutions, and enforce suffering upon those who dare to challenge the regime. It is a profound institutional erosion, designed to subjugate political opposition through the weaponization of state power.\n\n*   **Centralization of Power and Weakening of Democratic Institutions**: This EO represents an egregious, unconstitutional expansion of executive power into the domestic political sphere, deliberately bypassing established legal frameworks designed for foreign terrorist organizations. Legal experts consistently highlight that \"Antifa\" is not a cohesive group but a decentralized movement or ideology, making its designation as a \"terrorist organization\" a legal absurdity. This action grants the executive branch unprecedented and legally dubious authority to surveil, prosecute, and financially cripple any individual or group merely perceived to align with anti-fascist sentiments. Such a concentration of power erodes the separation of powers and sets a dangerous precedent for future unilateral executive rulemaking, effectively weaponizing counterterrorism tools against legitimate domestic political activity and dissent.\n*   **Advancement of a Dictatorial Agenda**: This Executive Order is a transparent and insidious attempt to criminalize dissent and recharacterize legitimate political opposition as terrorism. The intentionally expansive definition of \"material support\" under existing statutes—which can encompass \"currency or monetary instruments, financial services, lodging, training, expert advice or assistance, safehouses, false documentation, communications equipment, facilities, weapons, personnel, and transportation\"—creates a chilling effect on free speech and association. This legal overreach fundamentally assaults the First Amendment, designed to silence critics and dismantle civil society organizations that might challenge the administration's authoritarian trajectory. The order, coupled with National Security Presidential Memorandum 7, directs federal law enforcement to prioritize investigations into ideologies depicted as falling under \"anti-fascism,\" including \"anti-Americanism, anti-capitalism, and anti-Christianity,\" turning federal agencies into instruments for prosecuting political beliefs.\n*   **Beneficiaries vs. Public Good**: The primary beneficiaries of this EO are the administration itself and its far-right ideological allies, who seek to eliminate organized resistance and consolidate their plutocratic entrenchment. By equating anti-fascism with terrorism, the administration can justify aggressive tactics against protesters, activists, and even journalists, thereby suppressing any meaningful challenge to its agenda. The public good, conversely, is severely undermined as fundamental civil liberties are eroded, and the very concept of political dissent is delegitimized. This move provides a pretext for increased surveillance, asset freezes, and criminal prosecutions against those who advocate for human rights, social justice, and environmental protection.\n\n### Connection to Broader Agenda\nThis Executive Order is not an isolated policy blip; it is a structural, searing move in a larger pattern of executive overreach and institutional erosion. It is a critical component of the administration's overarching strategy of rising fascism and authoritarian dictatorship, meticulously outlined in blueprints like Project 2025. The designation of \"Antifa\" as a domestic terrorist organization directly implements Project 2025's call for the expansion of executive power and the targeting of perceived political enemies. This aligns with the administration's broader agenda to:\n\n*   **Dismantle Checks and Balances**: By asserting unilateral authority to define and prosecute domestic political movements, the administration further erodes the independence of the Department of Justice and other agencies, bending them to presidential will. This relentless assault on constitutional norms consolidates power within the executive branch, transforming agencies into partisan enforcers.\n*   **Suppress Dissent and Free Speech**: This EO creates a climate of pervasive fear, discouraging any form of organized protest or advocacy that could be misconstrued as \"Antifa-affiliated\". This is consistent with a wider effort to control the narrative and silence critical voices, essential for an authoritarian regime. The vagueness of \"Antifa\" means lawful political expression can be subjected to the same treatment as terrorism, chilling activism and punishing economic alternatives.\n*   **Politicize the Federal Government**: This action complements other administrative directives, such as the reclassification of tens of thousands of federal civil service positions into political appointments (Schedule F), ensuring that the bureaucracy is staffed by loyalists willing to enforce such draconian directives. This systematic dismantling of an apolitical civil service facilitates the subjugation of government functions to partisan objectives, accelerating the decline of democratic governance.\n*   **Economic Subjugation**: While this report focuses on the designation of Antifa, it is crucial to recognize that this administration’s broader agenda also includes economic measures, such as the weaponization of tariffs (e.g., Executive Order 14266 on reciprocal tariff rates) through emergency powers, which function as regressive taxes on households and small businesses, further concentrating wealth and power with politically favored industries. This economic subjugation, coupled with the assault on civil liberties, paints a stark picture of plutocratic entrenchment.\n\n### Harm Assessment\nThe tangible negative consequences of this Executive Order are profound and far-reaching, inflicting severe harm on vulnerable populations and systematically undermining the foundational principles of a free and democratic society.\n\n*   **Harm to Vulnerable Populations**: Individuals and groups who engage in anti-fascist activism—often including marginalized communities, racial justice advocates, and LGBTQ+ allies—are now explicitly targeted. The intentionally vague and amorphous nature of \"Antifa\" means that anyone expressing opposition to far-right ideologies could be swept into this dragnet, facing surveillance, harassment, and potential criminal charges, leading to pervasive fear and self-censorship within these communities.\n*   **Erosion of Rights**: The EO directly and aggressively threatens First Amendment rights to free speech, assembly, and association. The broad interpretation of \"material support\" means that even passive support for anti-fascist ideals, or mere ideological affinity, could lead to severe legal repercussions, effectively criminalizing thought and opinion and setting a dangerous precedent for future administrations to label any inconvenient political movement as \"terrorist\".\n*   **Chilling Effect on Civil Society**: Non-profit organizations, advocacy groups, and even social media platforms will face immense pressure to distance themselves from anything resembling \"Antifa\" or risk being implicated in \"material support\" charges or facing IRS investigations into their tax-exempt status. This will stifle legitimate activism, reduce civic engagement, and create a dangerous vacuum for authoritarian narratives to flourish, eroding the very fabric of civil society.\n*   **Legal and Institutional Damage**: The administration's lack of statutory authority to designate domestic groups as terrorist organizations creates legal uncertainty and invites protracted, costly litigation. This undermines the rule of law and wastes judicial and agency resources, all while the administration's actions demonstrate a calculated disregard for constitutional limits on executive power.\n*   **International Implications**: This Executive Order has already spurred international far-right parties to demand similar designations in their own countries, demonstrating a coordinated global effort to eliminate organized resistance to far-right governance. This legitimizes authoritarian tactics on a global scale, further isolating the U.S. from democratic allies and undermining international human rights norms.\n\n### Reversal Strategy\nTo undo the profound and systemic damage inflicted by this egregious Executive Order, the next administration must undertake immediate, decisive, and comprehensive actions on Day One.\n\n1.  **Rescind the Executive Order Immediately**: The incoming administration must issue an Executive Order rescinding the \"Executive Order on Designating Antifa as a Domestic Terrorist Organization,\" thereby nullifying its legal force and unequivocally signaling a commitment to protecting civil liberties and constitutional governance. (Authority: Article II, Section 1 of the U.S. Constitution grants the President executive power, including the inherent ability to issue and rescind Executive Orders. This act would align with the constitutional requirement for presidential actions to be consistent with the law.)\n2.  **Issue New Guidance and Reaffirm Constitutional Protections**: The Department of Justice and Department of Homeland Security must issue clear, public guidance to all federal agencies, explicitly reaffirming the constitutional protections for free speech, assembly, and association, and stating unambiguously that ideological opposition is not terrorism, and that counterterrorism tools will not be deployed against domestic political movements or expressions of dissent. (Authority: The Attorney General and Secretary of Homeland Security, under presidential directive, possess the authority to issue new policy guidance and directives to federal agencies to ensure fidelity to constitutional principles and statutory limitations. This would immediately halt any ongoing investigations or prosecutions based solely on this flawed EO.)\n3.  **Initiate Legislative Safeguards Against Executive Overreach**: The administration must work collaboratively with Congress to enact robust legislation that narrowly defines domestic terrorism, explicitly prohibiting the executive branch from designating amorphous ideologies or decentralized movements as terrorist organizations. This legislation must safeguard against future abuses of power and reinforce the separation of powers by clarifying the proper scope of executive authority in matters of domestic security and free expression. (Authority: Article I, Section 8 of the U.S. Constitution grants Congress the power to make laws necessary and proper for carrying into execution powers vested in the government, including legislation that defines and limits executive authority, particularly in areas touching upon fundamental civil liberties.)\n\nDoc B (id=B):\n1.

[Descriptive Title]\nThe Emergency‑Tariff Coup and The Authoritarian’s Decree on Dissent: Weaponizing “national emergency” and counter‑terror tools to tax the many, silence opposition, and cement plutocratic entrenchment.\n\n4. What the EO Does\n- Tariff EO (Executive Order 14266 — “Modifying Reciprocal Tariff Rates…”):  \n  - Declares and relies on emergency authorities (IEEPA and the National Emergencies Act) and cites trade statutes to authorize sweeping changes to the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS). ([federalregister.gov](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/full_text/html/2025/04/15/2025-06462.html?utm_source=openai))  \n  - Suspends specified country- and product‑specific ad valorem headings and replaces them with a uniform additional ad valorem duty for a defined period (a 10% baseline across enumerated trading partners in the April 2025 modification) and separately escalates China‑specific headings (text shows increases to the specified HTSUS entries, including very high ad valorem insertions). ([federalregister.gov](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/full_text/html/2025/04/15/2025-06462.html?utm_source=openai))  \n  - Grants broad administrative discretion to modify HTSUS headings, to make conditional carve‑outs for “aligned” partners, and to escalate duties in response to declared or perceived retaliation by trading partners — effectively creating a political lever tied to subjective “alignment” judgments. ([whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/modifying-reciprocal-tariff-rates-to-reflect-trading-partner-retaliation-and-alignment/?utm_source=openai))\n\n- Antifa EO (September 22, 2025 — “Designating Antifa as a Domestic Terrorist Organization”):  \n  - Formally designates “Antifa” as a “domestic terrorist organization,” directs “all relevant executive departments and agencies” to use “all applicable authorities” to investigate, disrupt, and dismantle illegal operations and to prosecute and pursue those who provide material support. ([whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/09/designating-antifa-as-a-domestic-terrorist-organization/?utm_source=openai))  \n  - Casts a very wide net: orders investigatory/prosecutorial activity against anyone “acting on behalf of Antifa” and those who fund such operations, and instructs agencies to marshal all applicable authorities consistent with law. ([whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/09/designating-antifa-as-a-domestic-terrorist-organization/?utm_source=openai))\n\n5. Stated Purpose & Justification\n- Tariff EO (official line): The Administration frames the tariff modifications as necessary responses to “large and persistent” U.S. goods trade deficits and to foreign retaliatory tariffs — presented as emergency measures to protect national and economic security, to make reciprocal tariffs effective, and to incentivize trading‑partner cooperation. The White House text ties the measures to prior EOs addressing deficits and to specific retaliatory acts by trading partners. ([whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/modifying-reciprocal-tariff-rates-to-reflect-trading-partner-retaliation-and-alignment/?utm_source=openai))\n\n- Antifa EO (official line): The Administration asserts that Antifa constitutes a militarist, anarchic threat that engages in coordinated political violence and obstruction of federal law enforcement; the EO is presented as a law‑enforcement imperative to protect public safety, prevent political violence, and dismantle funding and operational networks that allegedly enable violence. The White House fact sheet repeats this justification. ([whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/09/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-designates-antifa-as-a-domestic-terrorist-organization/?utm_source=openai))\n\n6. Nefarious Reality & True Impact\nSummary statement: Taken together these EOs amount to two sides of the same authoritarian playbook — one transforms emergency economic authority into a permanent revenue and leverage machine that shifts costs onto the population and rewards politically connected actors; the other weaponizes counter‑terror authorities to criminalize dissent and shrink civic space. Both centralize discretionary power in the Executive, erode legal guardrails, and impose systemic harms that will persist beyond the immediate actions.\n\n6.a Centralization of power and institutional erosion\n- Tariff EO: By invoking IEEPA and the National Emergencies Act to rewrite the HTSUS, the Administration substitutes presidential fiat for Congress’s trade prerogatives and for the deliberative processes traditionally run by USTR and trade statutes. The text explicitly relies on emergency authorities and suspensions of ordinary HTSUS entries — a structural replacement of normal statutory decisionmaking with executive discretion. That concentration of authority is evident in the Federal Register text and the White House order. ([federalregister.gov](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/full_text/html/2025/04/15/2025-06462.html?utm_source=openai))\n\n- Antifa EO: The designation of a loosely defined ideology or movement as a “domestic terrorist organization” expands prosecutorial and intelligence remit into political activity and associational life. The EO’s command that agencies use “all applicable authorities” to investigate and dismantle operations gives the Executive sweeping latitude to employ counterterrorism tools against domestic political opposition in ways the statute and constitutional traditions did not contemplate. ([whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/09/designating-antifa-as-a-domestic-terrorist-organization/?utm_source=openai))\n\n6.b A punitive, politically fungible instrument\n- Tariff EO: The “alignment” rubric built into the tariff framework converts trade policy into bargaining chips — tariff relief can be traded for political concessions; escalation can be used as punishment. That transforms tariffs from predictable trade tools into discretionary instruments of coercion and clientelism. Independent reporting and industry accounts document rapid reclassification, product redesign, and turmoil in customs administration as firms attempt to navigate an erratic policy environment. ([washingtonpost.com](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/11/28/trump-tariffs-customs-brokers/?utm_source=openai))\n\n- Antifa EO: Broad “material support” language, when applied domestically to amorphous movements, criminalizes a range of benign civic behaviors and creates prosecutorial discretion to silence or bankrupt opponents. The EO’s sweep risks treating ordinary political donors, communications facilitators, and mutual aid organizers as potential criminal actors if they are perceived to align with anti‑fascist ideas. ([whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/09/designating-antifa-as-a-domestic-terrorist-organization/?utm_source=openai))\n\n6.c Enforcement as extraction and subjugation\n- Tariff EO: The economic incidence of broad new ad valorem duties falls on consumers, workers, and small businesses — effectively a regressive tax on consumption that produces windfall rents for protected producers and the Treasury while suppressing real incomes and demand. Reporting on the tariffs shows firms responding with “tariff‑engineering” and supply‑chain redesign, which imposes compliance costs and market distortions. ([washingtonpost.com](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/11/28/trump-tariffs-customs-brokers/?utm_source=openai))\n\n- Antifa EO: The invocation of counterterror powers against political actors imposes chilling costs on dissenters, civil society, journalists, and organizers — with the likely result of self‑censorship, reduced protest and organizing, and targeted surveillance of marginalized communities that most often drive grassroots movements. International observers and civil‑liberties advocates warn that such measures normalize the criminalization of political opposition. ([theguardian.com](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/25/us-antifa-groups-terror-list?utm_source=openai))\n\n6.d Beneficiaries vs. public good\n- Tariff EO: Net beneficiaries are concentrated: import‑competing industries and politically connected firms able to capture protective rents; the Treasury also benefits from higher customs receipts. The public — consumers, low‑income households, and clean‑tech projects facing higher input costs — bears the economic pain and long‑run damage to growth and the energy transition. ([washingtonpost.com](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/11/28/trump-tariffs-customs-brokers/?utm_source=openai))\n\n- Antifa EO: Beneficiaries are political actors who gain from a debilitated civil society and a depoliticized media environment; the public good is eroded as core civil liberties and democratic checks on power are degraded. ([theguardian.com](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/25/us-antifa-groups-terror-list?utm_source=openai))\n\n6.e Support from reporting and legal commentary\n- The primary sources for the EOs are the executive texts themselves (Federal Register and White House releases). Independent reporting documents the market disruption, legal challenges, and international consequences of the tariff program; civil‑liberties commentary and press scrutiny catalog the unprecedented nature and dangers of designating movements like “Antifa” as terrorist organizations. ([federalregister.gov](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/full_text/html/2025/04/15/2025-06462.html?utm_source=openai))\n\nReasoning (Methodology and concise, non‑sensitive justification)\n- Step 1 — Verify: The official texts were read and cross‑checked against Federal Register and WhiteHouse postings to confirm exact statutory authorities invoked and precise operative directives. Evidence: EO text published on Federal Register and White House. ([federalregister.gov](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/full_text/html/2025/04/15/2025-06462.html?utm_source=openai))\n\n- Step 2 — Identify mechanisms: For the tariff EO I extracted the operative modifications to HTSUS (suspensions, added ad valorem rates, China‑specific escalations); for the antifa EO I extracted the operative language directing agencies to use “all applicable authorities” and to pursue “material support” cases. Evidence: statutory references and operative paragraphs in the EOs. ([federalregister.gov](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/full_text/html/2025/04/15/2025-06462.html?utm_source=openai))\n\n- Step 3 — Corroborate impact: I compared EO mechanisms to contemporaneous industry and press reporting on economic effects and administrative chaos (customs bookkeeping, tariff engineering) and to civil‑liberties critiques of domestic terrorism designations. These sources provide the best available proximate evidence of harm. Evidence: Washington Post reporting on tariff impacts; Guardian reporting and civil‑liberties coverage on antifa designation. ([washingtonpost.com](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/11/28/trump-tariffs-customs-brokers/?utm_source=openai))\n\n- Step 4 — Infer systemic effects cautiously: From the text and reporting, the most robust inferences are (a) the expansion and normalization of emergency executive authority over trade; (b) the plausible regressive and supply‑chain harms from broad ad valorem duties; and (c) the chilling civil‑liberties consequences of applying counterterror frameworks to decentralized political movements. Each inference is tied directly to textual authority and empirical reporting cited above. ([federalregister.gov](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/full_text/html/2025/04/15/2025-06462.html?utm_source=openai))\n\ncontent.parts[].text:\nThe conclusions above are based on direct textual evidence from the EOs and contemporaneous reporting. The tariff EO explicitly invokes emergency statutes and amends HTSUS entries; the antifa EO explicitly directs all agencies to use counterterror instruments. Where inference is required (for example, predicting distributive effects of tariffs or the chilling effect on dissent), the inferences rely on standard incidence analysis (tariffs raise consumer prices and are regressive) and on longstanding civil‑liberties doctrine (broad “material support” constructs chill association). The synthesis privileges primary texts for legal posture and respected press/think‑tank reporting for proximate impacts; judicial developments and empirical modeling are identified where available and cited.\n\n7. Connection to Broader Agenda\nThese EOs are coherent components of a larger authoritarian tilt: repeatedly invoking emergency authority to remake governance, weaponizing law‑enforcement and counterterror frameworks against political opponents, and reallocating economic rents toward politically favored actors are classical features of democratic backsliding. The tariff EO demonstrates a pattern of using “national emergency” labels to convert trade policy into an executive revenue/coercion tool; the antifa EO demonstrates a pattern of recoding political dissent as terrorism. Together they accelerate institutional erosion — hollowing out deliberative lawmaking, shrinking civic space, and enabling plutocratic capture of state instruments. The broader consequences include undermined social safety nets (as price shocks and slowed growth reduce real wages and tax space), delayed climate transition (higher costs for clean‑tech inputs), and global fragmentation (retaliatory trade measures and diplomatic fallout). ([federalregister.gov](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/full_text/html/2025/04/15/2025-06462.html?utm_source=openai))\n\n8. Harm Assessment — tangible negative consequences\n- Macroeconomic drag and distributional harm: Broad ad valorem tariffs across many headings function like consumption taxes; they raise final goods prices, slow growth, and lower household real incomes — hitting low‑income households hardest. Industry reporting shows immediate compliance costs and product redesign efforts that impose losses on small and medium firms. ([washingtonpost.com](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/11/28/trump-tariffs-customs-brokers/?utm_source=openai))\n\n- Environmental and climate setbacks: Tariffs on inputs for solar, batteries, and other clean‑technology components increase project costs, slow deployment, and prolong fossil‑fuel dependence; the tariff EO’s blanket headings risk materially delaying decarbonization investments if clean‑tech inputs are affected. ([federalregister.gov](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/full_text/html/2025/04/15/2025-06462.html?utm_source=openai))\n\n- Legal and institutional damage: Normalizing IEEPA/NEA use for trade policy and employing counterterror frameworks domestically create litigation, legal uncertainty, and institutional drift. Agencies diverted to enforcing politically contentious directives reduce capacity for routine governance and for protecting the public interest. Pending judicial scrutiny and industry lawsuits against tariff designations are already reported. ([federalregister.gov](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/full_text/html/2025/04/15/2025-06462.html?utm_source=openai))\n\n- Civil‑liberties and social harm: The Antifa EO’s breadth risks surveillance, criminal prosecutions, asset freezes, and ex parte administrative actions against organizers, donors, and journalists; marginalized groups — racial justice organizers, LGBTQ+ activists, immigrant advocates — are disproportionately exposed. Internationally, the move emboldens illiberal governments and far‑right actors to replicate measures that suppress dissent. ([whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/09/designating-antifa-as-a-domestic-terrorist-organization/?utm_source=openai))\n\n- Geopolitical blowback: Conditioning tariffs on perceived “alignment” invites reciprocal measures and negotiating brinkmanship. Reported retaliatory announcements and market disruptions show how the measure destabilizes trade relations and export markets for U.S. businesses. ([federalregister.gov](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/full_text/html/2025/04/15/2025-06462.html?utm_source=openai))\n\n9. Reversal Strategy — three immediate, concrete first acts (1–3 lines each, with authorities)\n1) Rescind both Executive Orders on Day One and republish the revocations in the Federal Register; instruct USTR, Treasury, Commerce, and CBP to halt any tariff amendments or enforcement actions taken under EO 14266 and to restore affected HTSUS headings to their pre‑EO configuration. (Authority and operative text: Executive revocation power; see EO 14266 and Federal Register publication for affected HTSUS entries.) ([federalregister.gov](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/full_text/html/2025/04/15/2025-06462.html?utm_source=openai))\n\n2) Terminate any “national emergency” finding used to justify the tariff program under the National Emergencies Act and issue an immediate Department of Justice/Department of Homeland Security directive clarifying that counterterrorism authorities and “material support” constructs shall not be used to criminalize lawful domestic political speech, association, or mutual aid; direct DOJ to decline defense of legally infirm uses of IEEPA for tariff imposition and to expedite settlement/refund procedures for importers harmed by the now‑repealed measures. (Authority: National Emergencies Act; Executive power to direct agency litigation posture.) ([federalregister.gov](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/full_text/html/2025/04/15/2025-06462.html?utm_source=openai))\n\n3) Seek rapid statutory cures and remedial appropriation: transmit to Congress a package (a) clarifying and restricting use of IEEPA and NEA for domestic economic regulation and expressly barring emergency tariff rewriting without express congressional authorization; (b) narrowly defining domestic terrorism to prevent designating amorphous ideologies or decentralized movements; and (c) appropriating a targeted transition fund for consumer compensation, supply‑chain assistance, and accelerated clean‑tech procurement to reverse climate and distributional harms. (Authority: Congress’s Article I trade and appropriations powers; Trade Act and National Emergencies Act frameworks.) ([federalregister.gov](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/full_text/html/2025/04/15/2025-06462.html?utm_source=openai))\n\nFinal operational note (concise)\n- These two EOs embody complementary strategies of executive aggrandizement: economic coercion through emergency trade authority and political suppression through broadened counterterror powers. Undoing their damage requires immediate executive revocation, legal housekeeping (termination of emergencies and litigation posture), and swift legislative repair to close statutory loopholes and fund remediation. Primary sources and contemporaneous reporting are linked above and provide the textual and empirical grounds for each recommended action.
