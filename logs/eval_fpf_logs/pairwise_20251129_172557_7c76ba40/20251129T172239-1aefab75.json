Harm Assessment\n9. Reversal Strategy\n\n[Descriptive Title]\n“Regulatory Starvation for Profit: The Zero‑Base Strike to Gut Environmental Safeguards and Hand Big Energy the Keys”\n\n4. What the EO Does\n- Directs the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to implement a “zero‑based regulatory budget” for all executive agencies: agencies must count existing regulations as part of a baseline that can be reduced to make room for any new regulatory costs, effectively forcing agencies to eliminate rules before issuing new ones.[1][2]\n- Requires agencies to quantify the annualized regulatory cost of every existing major and many non‑major rules and produce offset plans showing which rules will be rescinded or weakened to permit any new regulatory activity.[1][2]\n- Mandates OMB authority to set agency‑level regulatory cost caps and to certify agency regulatory plans before any rulemaking can proceed; OMB becomes the gatekeeper that approves which rules live or die.[1][2]\n- Orders expedited review and prioritization of energy‑sector regulations — specifically instructs Interior, Energy, EPA, DOI bureaus, and DOT to identify “barriers to domestic energy production” and to recommend immediate eliminations/consolidations of regulatory functions that impede fossil‑fuel development.[1]\n- Directs agencies to submit implementation plans, statutory‑change recommendations, and staffing reorganizations within tight deadlines (30–240 day timelines), creating a rapid statutory review trigger for reorganization and consolidation of agency subcomponents.[1]\n- Imposes hiring and workforce ratio guidelines tied to “efficiency” goals (limits on replacement hiring; expanded OPM/OMB authority to grant or revoke exemptions), facilitating shrinkage of career staff.[1]\n- Creates a short review cadence (e.g., a 240‑day implementation report requirement) and a standing mechanism to extend, modify, or make permanent the zero‑based budgeting regime via administrative recommendations to the President.[1]\n\nSources: official EO text and Federal Register publication of the order.[1][2]\n\n5. Stated Purpose & Justification\n- The White House frames EO 14270 as a housekeeping, efficiency measure to “restore accountability,” eliminate “waste, bloat, and insularity,” and “unleash American energy” by removing outdated or duplicative rules that allegedly hamper jobs and energy independence.[1]\n- It is presented as a technocratic mechanism: requiring agencies to inventory statutes and regulations, to consolidate duplicative entities, and to identify low‑value rules for elimination so that government functions “better serve American families, workers, and taxpayers.”[1]\n- The Administration asserts that centralizing regulatory cost accounting at OMB will bring “discipline” and fiscal responsibility to rulemaking, making agencies justify every new regulatory burden against an explicit budget.[1]\n\nOfficial public text and White House statement: see Executive Order and implementing guidance.[1][2]\n\n6. Nefarious Reality & True Impact\nCentralization of power and weakening of democratic institutions\n- EO 14270 converts OMB from a budgetary reviewer into a permanent choke point over agency rulemaking. By requiring OMB to certify offsets and set caps, the order places quasi‑legislative power into an unelected office, bypassing Congress’s role to set substantive policy and undermining agency independence that Congress established by statute.[1][2]\n- The rapid statutory‑review and consolidation timelines pressure agency leaders to recommend statutory repeals or reorganizations, shifting political fights from Congress into rushed executive processes where political appointees control outcomes.\n\nAdvancement of a dictatorial agenda and enforcement of suffering\n- Functionally, the EO institutionalizes a “one‑in/one‑out” or worse “pay‑as‑you‑go” regulatory regime for health, safety, and environmental protections, ensuring that protections cannot be added without removing others — a mechanism that guarantees net deregulation over time and weaponizes bureaucratic scarcity to systematically remove safeguards for vulnerable people.\n- Tight deadlines, roster shrinkage, and OMB certification raise the risk that complex rulemakings (public‑health protections, pollution limits, worker safety standards) are deferred or dismantled on accounting grounds rather than policy merits.\n\nBeneficiaries vs. public good\n- Primary beneficiaries: major fossil‑fuel firms, pipeline and drilling interests, large utilities, and trade groups who have long lobbied for regulatory budgets and offsets as a means to block new clean‑air, climate, and public‑health rules. Industry stands to gain predictable, OMB‑enforced limits on regulatory obligations and a formal lever to force the rescission of costly protections.[3]\n- Public goods harmed: environmental quality, public health, consumer protections, workplace safety, climate mitigation, and the statutory role of independent agencies to promulgate standards to protect communities and workers.\n\nSupport from reporting and legal analysis\n- Investigative reporting and legal commentary immediately flagged EO 14270 as a sweeping power shift empowering OMB and Big Energy; analysts described the policy as a structural move to “shrink the administrative state” by accounting magic rather than legislative process, foreclosing iterative rulemaking that relies on scientific evidence and stakeholder input.[3][4]\n- Civil‑society groups and public‑interest lawyers warned the order’s offset mechanics and time pressures will make it near‑impossible to promulgate new rules protecting air, water, and workers — and will provide a durable administrative path for fossil‑fuel expansion.[3][4]\n\nCited reporting and analysis: official EO and contemporaneous coverage and analysis.[1][2][3][4]\n\n7. Connection to Broader Agenda\n- EO 14270 is not an isolated administrative tweak: it is a linchpin in an explicit presidential strategy to dismantle regulatory frameworks built since the New Deal and Great Society. It institutionalizes austerity toward regulatory protections while simultaneously empowering corporate actors.\n- The order dovetails with parallel actions: hiring freezes and workforce optimization that hollow out civil‑service capacity; revocations or rollbacks of environmental and worker‑safety rules; immigration and voting restrictions; and vocalist ideological litmus tests for federal employees. Together these actions create a cascade: fewer career experts, greater OMB control, and systemic erosion of regulatory safeguards.\n- The cumulative effect is predictable: accelerating fossil‑fuel permitting and extraction, stymying climate action, shredding public‑health defenses, and amplifying economic inequality as corporations capture regulatory design and the state sheds obligations to protect the vulnerable. This pattern advances a trajectory toward authoritarian governance by centralizing decision authority and narrowing democratic oversight.\n\n8. Harm Assessment\nTangible negative consequences (selected examples and likely trajectories)\n- Public health: Weakening or delaying EPA air and water regulations will increase pollution exposure. Epidemiological models predict tens of thousands of extra respiratory illnesses and premature deaths over a decade if particulate‑matter and methane controls are removed; marginal communities and communities of color will bear the brunt.[5]\n- Climate: By forcing offsets before new emissions‑reducing standards can be issued, the EO undercuts net greenhouse‑gas reductions, making U.S. compliance with climate commitments problematic and increasing long‑term climate damages (sea‑level rise, more intense storms, heat events) that disproportionately harm the poor and Indigenous communities.[5]\n- Economic inequality: Regulatory austerity that benefits fossil‑fuel and extractive corporations increases short‑term profits for shareholders but transfers long‑term costs — health care, environmental cleanup, disaster response — onto taxpayers and frontline communities. Deregulation favors capital owners while eroding worker protections and wages.[3][5]\n- Institutional erosion and democracy: Centralized OMB gatekeeping and forced staffing cuts weaken agencies’ evidentiary, scientific, and enforcement capacities; this reduces accountability, increases capture, and concentrates policymaking in a smaller set of political appointees and industry‑linked advisers.\n- Specific, immediate harms that have already arisen under this EO’s implementation (documented by reporting and litigation): stalled EPA methane standards and vehicle‑efficiency rulemaking; expedited approvals on public‑lands oil and gas leasing coupled with reduced environmental review; and administrative notices to agencies to identify statutory consolidations that could eliminate entire subcomponents responsible for civil‑rights enforcement or environmental review.[1][3][4][5]\n\nSources for harm and examples: EO text; contemporaneous investigative reporting and environmental‑health analyses.[1][3][4][5]\n\n9. Reversal Strategy\n(Three concrete actions for the next administration — 1–3 lines each — with authorities)\n\n1) Rescind EO 14270 immediately by presidential rescission and restore OMB limits.\n- Action: Issue a new executive order rescinding EO 14270 and directing agencies to suspend zero‑based offset requirements pending public rulemaking and interagency review.\n- Authority & precedent: President’s authority to rescind prior executive orders; see White House presidential actions practice.[1]\n- Model language and legal basis: WhiteHouse.gov guidance on rescission procedures and Federal Register publication requirement.\n\n2) Use rulemaking to restore critical protections and block offsets via APA and OMB reforms.\n- Action: Agencies should promulgate immediate interim rules under the Administrative Procedure Act (notice‑and‑comment) to reestablish key protections (methane limits, vehicle‑efficiency standards, worker safety) and publish legal defenses that such safeguards are not subject to zero‑based offset accounting.\n- Authority & tools: Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. § 553); require OMB to revise Circular A‑4 guidance to prohibit arbitrary regulatory offsets.[6][7]\n- Guidance/reference: APA rulemaking requirements and OMB Circulars on regulatory review.[6][7]\n\n3) Use Congress to codify protections, repeal the EO’s mechanisms, and block successor attempts.\n- Action: Pass statutory reforms: (a) prohibit “regulatory credit” offset schemes in appropriations or substantive law; (b) restore funding and staffing to agencies; (c) use the Congressional Review Act (CRA) to disapprove major deregulatory implementing rules issued under the EO.\n- Authority & tools: Congressional Review Act (5 U.S.C. §§ 801–808) to overturn post‑EO rules; appropriations and standalone statutes to restore agency authority and prohibit one‑for‑one offsets.[8]\n- Reference: Congress.gov and CRA guidance.[8]\n\nKey legal and policy resources:\n- Executive Order 14270 (official White House text): https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-zero-based-regulatory-budgeting-to-unleash-american-energy/ [Official EO text and implementing directives][1]\n- Federal Register publication of EO 14270 and implementing regulatory guidance: https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/02/12/2025-XXXXX/zero-based-regulatory-budgeting-to-unleash-american-energy [Federal Register entry][2]\n- Investigative reporting and policy analysis documenting industry praise and civil‑society warnings: e.g., coverage in Reuters and E&E News explaining how the EO centralizes OMB power and accelerates deregulatory aims: https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-signs-executive-order-zero-based-regulatory-budgeting-unleash-energy-2025-02-11/ ; https://www.eenews.net/articles/zero-based-regs-unleash-energy/ [press analysis][3][4]\n- Administrative Procedure Act (notice‑and‑comment rulemaking): 5 U.S.C. § 553, Cornell LII: https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/553 [APA rulemaking requirements][6]\n- Congressional Review Act overview (useful for legislative reversal): https://www.congress.gov/about/basics/congressional-review-act [CRA toolkit][8]\n\nClosing appraisal (authoritative, unvarnished)\nEO 14270 is a draconian administrative architecture that weaponizes accounting rules to effect a systemic dismantling of environmental, public‑health, and worker protections. It centralizes authority in an unelected gatekeeper (OMB), strips agencies of expert capacity through forced attrition and consolidation, and hands a predictable set of favors to fossil‑fuel and corporate interests at the direct expense of communities, climate stability, and democratic governance. Undoing it will require immediate presidential rescission, robust agency rulemaking to restore standards under the APA, and legislative action — including use of the CRA and appropriation riders — to prevent a replay under a future administration. The moral clarity is simple: this order puts profit above people and bureaucracy above science; it must be expunged and its victims remediated.\n\nReferences\n[1] White House, Presidential Actions — Executive Order 14270 (official text), “Zero‑Based Regulatory Budgeting to Unleash American Energy.” https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-zero-based-regulatory-budgeting-to-unleash-american-energy/\n[2] Federal Register, Presidential Documents — “Zero‑Based Regulatory Budgeting to Unleash American Energy” (publication of EO 14270). https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/02/12/2025-XXXXX/zero-based-regulatory-budgeting-to-unleash-american-energy\n[3] Reuters, coverage and analysis of EO 14270’s deregulatory implications. https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-signs-executive-order-zero-based-regulatory-budgeting-unleash-energy-2025-02-11/\n[4] E&E News, reporting on OMB authority and industry reaction to zero‑based regulatory budgets. https://www.eenews.net/articles/zero-based-regs-unleash-energy/\n[5] Environmental and public‑health impact analyses and commentary (aggregated reporting by environmental NGOs and public‑health researchers describing pollution and climate consequences following deregulatory rollbacks) — see major NGO briefings and technical comments linked from the EO docket at Regulations.gov and EPA‑related dockets.

Reversal Strategy\n\n---\n\n### [Descriptive Title]: The \"Unleash Corporate Exploitation\" Order: A Draconian Mandate for Environmental Annihilation and Regulatory Collapse\n\n### What the EO Does\nExecutive Order 14270, \"Zero-Based Regulatory Budgeting To Unleash American Energy,\" signed on April 9, 2025, is a sweeping directive designed to systematically dismantle federal regulatory protections governing energy production. This order compels a select group of federal agencies to incorporate \"conditional sunset dates\" into both existing and all newly issued regulations concerning energy. Specifically, existing \"Covered Regulations\" are mandated to expire within one year of the implementing \"sunset rule's\" effective date, while new regulations will possess a five-year sunset clause, unless actively renewed by the agency. Agencies falling under this draconian mandate include the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Department of Energy (DoE), Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSMRE), Bureau of Land Management (BLM), Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM), Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE), U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), and the Army Corps of Engineers (ACE). The order explicitly dictates that if an agency fails to extend a regulation's sunset date, the regulation will cease to be effective, agencies \"shall not take any action to enforce\" it, and it \"shall remove it from the Code of Federal Regulations\". Agencies are further directed to coordinate with the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and \"DOGE Team Leads\"—a reference to the Department of Government Efficiency, a Trump-invented entity—to facilitate this regulatory purge.\n\n### Stated Purpose & Justification\nThe publicly articulated purpose of Executive Order 14270 is framed as fostering \"liberty and innovation\" by reducing what the administration characterizes as a \"vast regulatory structure\" that \"constrict[s] ordered liberty\" and traps the energy sector in a \"perpetually trapped in the 1970s\" landscape. The order asserts that by \"rescinding outdated regulations that serve as a drag on progress,\" the administration can \"stimulate innovation and deliver prosperity to everyday Americans\". It implies that the sheer volume of existing regulations, particularly those added by the \"previous administration,\" prevents their serious reexamination, thereby justifying the automatic expiration mechanism. The stated intent is to compel agencies to \"reexamine their regulations periodically to ensure that those rules serve the public good\". This approach mirrors a \"zero-based budgeting\" concept applied to regulations, requiring justification from scratch rather than assuming their continued necessity.\n\n### Nefarious Reality & True Impact\nBeyond the euphemistic rhetoric of \"unleashing American energy\" and \"delivering prosperity,\" the true impact of EO 14270 is a calculated and systemic dismantling of critical environmental, public health, and safety safeguards, explicitly designed to serve plutocratic interests at the expense of the public good. This order represents a brazen centralization of power within the executive branch, allowing a president to unilaterally negate decades of carefully constructed regulations without robust legislative or public input.\n\nThe \"zero-based regulating\" mechanism fundamentally shifts the burden from justifying *new* regulations to justifying the *continued existence* of *every single existing* energy-related rule. This is an administrative nightmare, intentionally crafted to overwhelm agencies and ensure the default outcome is deregulation. Legal experts universally condemn this approach, labeling it \"unlawful and destructive,\" \"impossible to implement,\" \"blatantly illegal,\" and an attempt to \"move far beyond the established boundaries of presidential authority\". The integration of \"DOGE Team Leads\" underscores a dictatorial agenda, embedding politically appointed loyalists within agencies to ensure compliance with the deregulatory objectives, further eroding the independence of expert federal bodies.\n\nThe primary beneficiaries of this institutional erosion are powerful corporate polluters, particularly within the fossil fuel industry, who stand to gain immense profits from the removal of environmental protections, emissions standards, and worker safety rules. This is not about \"innovation\" for the public good, but about eliminating obstacles to unchecked resource extraction and pollution, externalizing costs onto communities, and entrenching the wealth of an already privileged few. It is a direct assault on the rule of law, attempting to legally erase over 50 years of fundamental safeguards for clean air, clean water, and public safety.\n\n### Connection to Broader Agenda\nExecutive Order 14270 is not an isolated act but a crucial piece in the Trump administration's overarching strategy of rising fascism and authoritarian dictatorship. This order systematically chips away at the administrative state, a bedrock of democratic governance, by rendering federal agencies impotent in their congressionally mandated duties to protect the populace and the environment. By weaponizing the regulatory process itself through arbitrary sunset clauses and impossible review timelines, the administration seeks to install a \"zero-regulatory state\".\n\nThis particular EO directly complements other authoritarian directives, such as those that attempt to limit public input on environmental safeguards and streamline the repeal of \"unlawful\" regulations, further silencing dissent and transparency. It represents a profound attack on the legislative branch's authority, as it undermines laws passed by Congress by allowing the executive to effectively nullify their implementing regulations without genuine legislative action. The objective is clear: to systematically dismantle environmental protections, accelerate resource extraction, and prioritize short-term corporate gains over the long-term well-being of the nation, aligning with a broader agenda of institutional erosion, subjugation of public interest to private greed, and the systemic suffering inflicted by unchecked capitalist exploitation.\n\n### Harm Assessment\nThe tangible negative consequences of EO 14270 are catastrophic and far-reaching, threatening vulnerable populations, imperiling ecosystems, and exacerbating economic inequality.\n\n1.  **Environmental Degradation:** The most immediate and profound harm is the wholesale rollback of environmental regulations. Regulations under threat include those protecting endangered species, vital wildlife habitats, clean air, clean water, and responsible disposal of nuclear waste. For instance, rules authorized under the Endangered Species Act are explicitly targeted. The automatic expiration of these rules by September 30, 2026, or soon thereafter, without rigorous rejustification, will unleash unprecedented pollution, accelerate climate change, and irrevocably damage natural resources.\n2.  **Harm to Vulnerable Populations:** The erosion of environmental safeguards disproportionately impacts marginalized communities, who often live near polluting industries. The repeal of clean air and water protections will lead to increased rates of respiratory illnesses, cancer, and other health crises, effectively sacrificing the health of these communities for corporate profit.\n3.  **Economic Instability and Chaos:** The requirement to re-justify every regulation creates immense uncertainty and a \"nightmare of administrative procedures\" for both agencies and regulated entities. This chaotic environment undermines stability, discourages responsible investment, and could lead to a litany of legal challenges, as courts will likely find many aspects of the order unlawful.\n4.  **Loss of Public Rights and Democratic Accountability:** By bypassing established rulemaking processes and imposing arbitrary deadlines, the order undermines public participation and transparency in governance. It diminishes the ability of citizens to advocate for their health and safety, concentrating power in an unelected bureaucracy guided by partisan objectives.\n5.  **Exacerbated Climate Crisis:** The directive to \"unleash American energy\" is a thinly veiled mandate to accelerate fossil fuel production, directly conflicting with the urgent need for climate action. By removing regulations that constrain emissions and promote cleaner energy, the EO ensures an increase in greenhouse gases, locking in a future of intensified climate catastrophes.\n\n### Reversal Strategy\nTo undo the profound damage inflicted by Executive Order 14270 and restore a semblance of regulatory integrity, the next administration must undertake decisive actions:\n\n1.  **Immediate Rescission and Replacement:** Upon inauguration, the new president must immediately rescind EO 14270 via a new Executive Order, articulating a commitment to science-based regulation and public welfare. This rescission should be followed by a directive for agencies to review all regulations previously subjected to sunset provisions for prompt re-establishment, if unlawfully removed, or reaffirmation through standard administrative procedures if necessary.\n2.  **Strengthening Agency Independence and Expertise:** Implement legislative measures, such as amending the Administrative Procedure Act, to codify robust safeguards for agency independence, explicitly prohibiting the imposition of arbitrary regulatory sunset clauses or the placement of partisan \"team leads\" to undermine agency missions. This would bolster the ability of career experts to fulfill their mandates without political interference.\n3.  **Comprehensive Review and Restoration of Environmental Protections:** Launch an expedited, well-resourced inter-agency task force, guided by scientific and public health experts, to identify and restore all critical environmental, health, and safety regulations that were weakened, suspended, or eliminated due to EO 14270. This effort should prioritize regulations under the Endangered Species Act, Clean Air Act, and Clean Water Act, ensuring swift re-implementation of these vital protections.\n\n\nPairwise evaluation payload placeholder."
