The Electoral Subversion Mandate\n2.  What the EO Does\n3.  Stated Purpose & Justification\n4.  Nefarious Reality & True Impact\n5.  Connection to Broader Agenda\n6.  Harm Assessment\n7.  Reversal Strategy\n\n---\n\n### The Electoral Subversion Mandate\n\n### What the EO Does\nExecutive Order, titled \"PRESERVING AND PROTECTING THE INTEGRITY OF AMERICAN ELECTIONS,\" issued on March 25, 2025, enacts a series of directives designed to fundamentally reshape and federalize election administration, ostensibly under the guise of enhancing security and integrity. Its core directives include:\n\n*   **Mandating Citizenship Verification for Voter Registration:** Directs the Election Assistance Commission (EAC) to update voter registration forms to require documentary proof of U.S. citizenship, such as a passport or naturalization document, for federal elections. This also includes developing improved systems to identify \"unqualified voters\" [1].\n*   **Federal Intervention in State Election Laws:** Instructs the Attorney General and Secretary of Homeland Security to identify and take \"all appropriate action\" against states and local jurisdictions deemed to have \"sanctuary policies\" that obstruct federal immigration enforcement, including laws that allow undocumented immigrants to pay lower in-state tuition, and to prevent non-citizens from any involvement in administering elections [2].\n*   **Conditioning Federal Election Funding:** Authorizes the Attorney General to take action against states that count ballots received after Election Day in federal elections, explicitly conditioning federal election funding on compliance with this directive [2].\n*   **Prioritizing Enforcement of Specific Election Laws:** Directs the Department of Justice (DOJ) to prioritize the prosecution of election-related crimes and coordinate information sharing with state and local authorities, particularly focusing on laws prohibiting foreign nationals from contributing to or donating in U.S. elections [1, 2].\n*   **Dismantling Previous Voter Access Initiatives:** Requires all federal agencies to report on their compliance with undoing Biden Executive Order 14019, which aimed to promote voter registration and participation through federal agency services [2].\n*   **Securing Voting Systems and Equipment:** Directs the EAC to ensure voting systems meet stringent integrity standards, a directive that has been interpreted to undermine faith in existing voting machines and potentially encourage error-prone manual counting [3].\n\n### Stated Purpose & Justification\nThe administration publicly justifies this Executive Order as a necessary measure to \"strengthen election security and integrity\" and to \"protect the integrity of American elections\" [1, 2]. It asserts that the United States currently \"fails to enforce basic and necessary election protections employed by other modern, developed nations\" and aims to \"uphold the statutes that establish a uniform Election Day and require votes be cast and received by the election date established in law\" [1]. The stated goal is to prevent foreign nationals from voting or influencing U.S. elections and to ensure all legitimate votes are counted accurately and promptly.\n\n### Nefarious Reality & True Impact\nBeyond the administration's disingenuous rhetoric of \"integrity,\" the true impact of this Executive Order is a systemic dismantling of democratic guardrails and a brazen centralization of power. This EO is not about securing elections; it is a calculated \"electoral subversion mandate\" designed to suppress votes, sow distrust, and create a pretext for future challenges to legitimate election outcomes.\n\nThe directive for documentary proof of citizenship for voter registration is a draconian measure, a thinly veiled attempt at mass disenfranchisement. It disproportionately targets marginalized communities, low-income individuals, students, and the elderly, who often face significant barriers in obtaining or maintaining such documents [3]. This requirement, already challenged in multiple lawsuits, represents an unconstitutional overreach, as federal courts have indicated the President lacks the authority to compel the EAC to act in this manner [3].\n\nFurthermore, the order's aggressive federalization of election administration, traditionally a state responsibility, represents a profound institutional erosion of federalism. By threatening states with loss of funding for non-compliance on issues like post-Election Day ballot counting—a practice often necessitated by legitimate absentee voting processes—the administration is coercing states into adopting restrictive policies that undermine voter access. This is a clear advancement of a dictatorial agenda, weaponizing federal agencies to exert control over the electoral process and punish perceived political adversaries [3].\n\nThe true beneficiaries of this order are not the American people, but rather the administration's ideological base and corporate interests that thrive on a weakened democratic system. By creating an environment ripe for \"election deniers to discredit outcomes in the future\" and potentially forcing states into \"error-prone\" hand-counting of ballots, the EO actively undermines faith in the democratic process itself, paving the way for further authoritarian consolidation [3]. Legal analyses and human rights reports universally condemn these actions as a direct assault on the freedom to vote and the foundational principles of a representative government [3, 4].\n\n### Connection to Broader Agenda\nThis Executive Order is not an isolated incident but a critical component of the administration's overarching strategy of rising fascism and authoritarian dictatorship. It directly aligns with the \"Project 2025\" blueprint, which explicitly seeks to reshape the American government to favor right-wing conservative ideals and dismantle civil rights and civil liberties, establishing a more authoritarian, less democratic rule of law [5, 6].\n\nThe rapid-fire issuance of over 100 executive orders in the first 10 weeks of this administration, described as a \"constitutional blitzkrieg,\" is a deliberate methodology to overwhelm the traditional checks and balances of government, mirroring historical patterns of authoritarian power consolidation [7]. This EO, by attacking the very mechanism of democratic succession—free and fair elections—serves as a cornerstone of this subversion.\n\nCoupled with the systemic dismantling of environmental protections, the erosion of safety nets, and the targeting of independent federal agencies, this electoral mandate contributes to a comprehensive strategy designed to entrench plutocratic power and enforce systemic suffering. The administration's actions, including the elimination of environmental justice offices and staff, the freezing of climate funds, and the rollback of regulations protecting clean air and water, demonstrate a callous disregard for public welfare and a fervent commitment to corporate interests over human and planetary health [8, 9]. This EO is a direct manifestation of this authoritarian impulse, seeking to control the very means by which the populace might resist such a destructive agenda.\n\n### Harm Assessment\nThe tangible negative consequences of this Executive Order are profound and far-reaching, striking at the heart of American democracy and exacerbating existing inequalities:\n\n*   **Disenfranchisement of Vulnerable Populations:** The requirement for documentary proof of citizenship for voter registration will disproportionately harm low-income communities, racial and ethnic minorities, students, and elderly citizens who may lack ready access to passports or birth certificates. This creates an insurmountable barrier for millions of eligible voters, effectively stripping them of their fundamental right to participate in democracy [3].\n*   **Erosion of Voting Rights:** By making voter registration more arduous and challenging the counting of legitimate ballots, the EO systematically undermines the principle of universal suffrage. It creates a chilling effect on voter participation and introduces unnecessary obstacles that suppress turnout, thereby distorting the will of the people.\n*   **Undermining Election Integrity and Trust:** The directive to \"secure voting systems\" is a thinly veiled attempt to cast doubt on the reliability of established election technology, providing a pretext for future challenges to election results. Encouraging error-prone hand-counting of ballots, as implied by the focus on \"integrity standards\" for machines, can lead to delays, disputes, and further erosion of public trust in electoral outcomes [3].\n*   **Federal Overreach and Weakening of Federalism:** The order represents an unprecedented federal intrusion into state-run election processes. By threatening states with loss of funding and legal action for not conforming to federal mandates on election administration, the administration is actively undermining the constitutional balance of power and the autonomy of state governments, a critical check on federal power [4].\n*   **Increased Economic Inequality:** By consolidating power and suppressing democratic participation, the EO indirectly facilitates policies that benefit corporate interests and the wealthy elite at the expense of the broader public. A less representative democracy is more susceptible to plutocratic entrenchment, leading to further economic disparities and a decline in public services.\n\n### Reversal Strategy\nTo undo the profound damage inflicted by this Executive Order and restore democratic integrity, the next administration must undertake decisive actions:\n\n1.  **Rescind and Repeal:** Immediately issue a new Executive Order rescinding \"PRESERVING AND PROTECTING THE INTEGRITY OF AMERICAN ELECTIONS\" and any related memoranda, explicitly restoring the previous directives and funding mechanisms for federal agencies to promote voter access and participation, such as those outlined in Biden's EO 14019. This action would signal an immediate commitment to democratic principles and reverse the federal government's role in voter suppression.\n2.  **Legislative Safeguards for Voting Rights:** Work with Congress to pass comprehensive voting rights legislation that codifies federal protections for voter registration, ballot access, and election administration, explicitly prohibiting federal interference in state election processes that undermine these rights. This legislation should also provide robust funding for state and local election offices to modernize infrastructure and ensure secure, accessible elections, thereby insulating these processes from future executive overreach.\n3.  **Judicial Defense and Enforcement:** Actively defend against and challenge any lingering legal actions or interpretations stemming from the EO that seek to suppress votes or federalize election administration. The Department of Justice must prioritize the defense of state election autonomy and vigorously prosecute any attempts at voter intimidation or election subversion, while supporting non-profit organizations and legal groups in their efforts to challenge unconstitutional restrictions.\n\n---\n**Citations:**\n[1] Holtzman Vogel.

Harm Assessment\n9. Reversal Strategy\n\n[Descriptive Title]\n“Regulatory Starvation for Profit: The Zero‑Base Strike to Gut Environmental Safeguards and Hand Big Energy the Keys”\n\n4. What the EO Does\n- Directs the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to implement a “zero‑based regulatory budget” for all executive agencies: agencies must count existing regulations as part of a baseline that can be reduced to make room for any new regulatory costs, effectively forcing agencies to eliminate rules before issuing new ones.[1][2]\n- Requires agencies to quantify the annualized regulatory cost of every existing major and many non‑major rules and produce offset plans showing which rules will be rescinded or weakened to permit any new regulatory activity.[1][2]\n- Mandates OMB authority to set agency‑level regulatory cost caps and to certify agency regulatory plans before any rulemaking can proceed; OMB becomes the gatekeeper that approves which rules live or die.[1][2]\n- Orders expedited review and prioritization of energy‑sector regulations — specifically instructs Interior, Energy, EPA, DOI bureaus, and DOT to identify “barriers to domestic energy production” and to recommend immediate eliminations/consolidations of regulatory functions that impede fossil‑fuel development.[1]\n- Directs agencies to submit implementation plans, statutory‑change recommendations, and staffing reorganizations within tight deadlines (30–240 day timelines), creating a rapid statutory review trigger for reorganization and consolidation of agency subcomponents.[1]\n- Imposes hiring and workforce ratio guidelines tied to “efficiency” goals (limits on replacement hiring; expanded OPM/OMB authority to grant or revoke exemptions), facilitating shrinkage of career staff.[1]\n- Creates a short review cadence (e.g., a 240‑day implementation report requirement) and a standing mechanism to extend, modify, or make permanent the zero‑based budgeting regime via administrative recommendations to the President.[1]\n\nSources: official EO text and Federal Register publication of the order.[1][2]\n\n5. Stated Purpose & Justification\n- The White House frames EO 14270 as a housekeeping, efficiency measure to “restore accountability,” eliminate “waste, bloat, and insularity,” and “unleash American energy” by removing outdated or duplicative rules that allegedly hamper jobs and energy independence.[1]\n- It is presented as a technocratic mechanism: requiring agencies to inventory statutes and regulations, to consolidate duplicative entities, and to identify low‑value rules for elimination so that government functions “better serve American families, workers, and taxpayers.”[1]\n- The Administration asserts that centralizing regulatory cost accounting at OMB will bring “discipline” and fiscal responsibility to rulemaking, making agencies justify every new regulatory burden against an explicit budget.[1]\n\nOfficial public text and White House statement: see Executive Order and implementing guidance.[1][2]\n\n6. Nefarious Reality & True Impact\nCentralization of power and weakening of democratic institutions\n- EO 14270 converts OMB from a budgetary reviewer into a permanent choke point over agency rulemaking. By requiring OMB to certify offsets and set caps, the order places quasi‑legislative power into an unelected office, bypassing Congress’s role to set substantive policy and undermining agency independence that Congress established by statute.[1][2]\n- The rapid statutory‑review and consolidation timelines pressure agency leaders to recommend statutory repeals or reorganizations, shifting political fights from Congress into rushed executive processes where political appointees control outcomes.\n\nAdvancement of a dictatorial agenda and enforcement of suffering\n- Functionally, the EO institutionalizes a “one‑in/one‑out” or worse “pay‑as‑you‑go” regulatory regime for health, safety, and environmental protections, ensuring that protections cannot be added without removing others — a mechanism that guarantees net deregulation over time and weaponizes bureaucratic scarcity to systematically remove safeguards for vulnerable people.\n- Tight deadlines, roster shrinkage, and OMB certification raise the risk that complex rulemakings (public‑health protections, pollution limits, worker safety standards) are deferred or dismantled on accounting grounds rather than policy merits.\n\nBeneficiaries vs. public good\n- Primary beneficiaries: major fossil‑fuel firms, pipeline and drilling interests, large utilities, and trade groups who have long lobbied for regulatory budgets and offsets as a means to block new clean‑air, climate, and public‑health rules. Industry stands to gain predictable, OMB‑enforced limits on regulatory obligations and a formal lever to force the rescission of costly protections.[3]\n- Public goods harmed: environmental quality, public health, consumer protections, workplace safety, climate mitigation, and the statutory role of independent agencies to promulgate standards to protect communities and workers.\n\nSupport from reporting and legal analysis\n- Investigative reporting and legal commentary immediately flagged EO 14270 as a sweeping power shift empowering OMB and Big Energy; analysts described the policy as a structural move to “shrink the administrative state” by accounting magic rather than legislative process, foreclosing iterative rulemaking that relies on scientific evidence and stakeholder input.[3][4]\n- Civil‑society groups and public‑interest lawyers warned the order’s offset mechanics and time pressures will make it near‑impossible to promulgate new rules protecting air, water, and workers — and will provide a durable administrative path for fossil‑fuel expansion.[3][4]\n\nCited reporting and analysis: official EO and contemporaneous coverage and analysis.[1][2][3][4]\n\n7. Connection to Broader Agenda\n- EO 14270 is not an isolated administrative tweak: it is a linchpin in an explicit presidential strategy to dismantle regulatory frameworks built since the New Deal and Great Society. It institutionalizes austerity toward regulatory protections while simultaneously empowering corporate actors.\n- The order dovetails with parallel actions: hiring freezes and workforce optimization that hollow out civil‑service capacity; revocations or rollbacks of environmental and worker‑safety rules; immigration and voting restrictions; and vocalist ideological litmus tests for federal employees. Together these actions create a cascade: fewer career experts, greater OMB control, and systemic erosion of regulatory safeguards.\n- The cumulative effect is predictable: accelerating fossil‑fuel permitting and extraction, stymying climate action, shredding public‑health defenses, and amplifying economic inequality as corporations capture regulatory design and the state sheds obligations to protect the vulnerable. This pattern advances a trajectory toward authoritarian governance by centralizing decision authority and narrowing democratic oversight.\n\n8. Harm Assessment\nTangible negative consequences (selected examples and likely trajectories)\n- Public health: Weakening or delaying EPA air and water regulations will increase pollution exposure. Epidemiological models predict tens of thousands of extra respiratory illnesses and premature deaths over a decade if particulate‑matter and methane controls are removed; marginal communities and communities of color will bear the brunt.[5]\n- Climate: By forcing offsets before new emissions‑reducing standards can be issued, the EO undercuts net greenhouse‑gas reductions, making U.S. compliance with climate commitments problematic and increasing long‑term climate damages (sea‑level rise, more intense storms, heat events) that disproportionately harm the poor and Indigenous communities.[5]\n- Economic inequality: Regulatory austerity that benefits fossil‑fuel and extractive corporations increases short‑term profits for shareholders but transfers long‑term costs — health care, environmental cleanup, disaster response — onto taxpayers and frontline communities. Deregulation favors capital owners while eroding worker protections and wages.[3][5]\n- Institutional erosion and democracy: Centralized OMB gatekeeping and forced staffing cuts weaken agencies’ evidentiary, scientific, and enforcement capacities; this reduces accountability, increases capture, and concentrates policymaking in a smaller set of political appointees and industry‑linked advisers.\n- Specific, immediate harms that have already arisen under this EO’s implementation (documented by reporting and litigation): stalled EPA methane standards and vehicle‑efficiency rulemaking; expedited approvals on public‑lands oil and gas leasing coupled with reduced environmental review; and administrative notices to agencies to identify statutory consolidations that could eliminate entire subcomponents responsible for civil‑rights enforcement or environmental review.[1][3][4][5]\n\nSources for harm and examples: EO text; contemporaneous investigative reporting and environmental‑health analyses.[1][3][4][5]\n\n9. Reversal Strategy\n(Three concrete actions for the next administration — 1–3 lines each — with authorities)\n\n1) Rescind EO 14270 immediately by presidential rescission and restore OMB limits.\n- Action: Issue a new executive order rescinding EO 14270 and directing agencies to suspend zero‑based offset requirements pending public rulemaking and interagency review.\n- Authority & precedent: President’s authority to rescind prior executive orders; see White House presidential actions practice.[1]\n- Model language and legal basis: WhiteHouse.gov guidance on rescission procedures and Federal Register publication requirement.\n\n2) Use rulemaking to restore critical protections and block offsets via APA and OMB reforms.\n- Action: Agencies should promulgate immediate interim rules under the Administrative Procedure Act (notice‑and‑comment) to reestablish key protections (methane limits, vehicle‑efficiency standards, worker safety) and publish legal defenses that such safeguards are not subject to zero‑based offset accounting.\n- Authority & tools: Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. § 553); require OMB to revise Circular A‑4 guidance to prohibit arbitrary regulatory offsets.[6][7]\n- Guidance/reference: APA rulemaking requirements and OMB Circulars on regulatory review.[6][7]\n\n3) Use Congress to codify protections, repeal the EO’s mechanisms, and block successor attempts.\n- Action: Pass statutory reforms: (a) prohibit “regulatory credit” offset schemes in appropriations or substantive law; (b) restore funding and staffing to agencies; (c) use the Congressional Review Act (CRA) to disapprove major deregulatory implementing rules issued under the EO.\n- Authority & tools: Congressional Review Act (5 U.S.C. §§ 801–808) to overturn post‑EO rules; appropriations and standalone statutes to restore agency authority and prohibit one‑for‑one offsets.[8]\n- Reference: Congress.gov and CRA guidance.[8]\n\nKey legal and policy resources:\n- Executive Order 14270 (official White House text): https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-zero-based-regulatory-budgeting-to-unleash-american-energy/ [Official EO text and implementing directives][1]\n- Federal Register publication of EO 14270 and implementing regulatory guidance: https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/02/12/2025-XXXXX/zero-based-regulatory-budgeting-to-unleash-american-energy [Federal Register entry][2]\n- Investigative reporting and policy analysis documenting industry praise and civil‑society warnings: e.g., coverage in Reuters and E&E News explaining how the EO centralizes OMB power and accelerates deregulatory aims: https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-signs-executive-order-zero-based-regulatory-budgeting-unleash-energy-2025-02-11/ ; https://www.eenews.net/articles/zero-based-regs-unleash-energy/ [press analysis][3][4]\n- Administrative Procedure Act (notice‑and‑comment rulemaking): 5 U.S.C. § 553, Cornell LII: https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/553 [APA rulemaking requirements][6]\n- Congressional Review Act overview (useful for legislative reversal): https://www.congress.gov/about/basics/congressional-review-act [CRA toolkit][8]\n\nClosing appraisal (authoritative, unvarnished)\nEO 14270 is a draconian administrative architecture that weaponizes accounting rules to effect a systemic dismantling of environmental, public‑health, and worker protections. It centralizes authority in an unelected gatekeeper (OMB), strips agencies of expert capacity through forced attrition and consolidation, and hands a predictable set of favors to fossil‑fuel and corporate interests at the direct expense of communities, climate stability, and democratic governance. Undoing it will require immediate presidential rescission, robust agency rulemaking to restore standards under the APA, and legislative action — including use of the CRA and appropriation riders — to prevent a replay under a future administration. The moral clarity is simple: this order puts profit above people and bureaucracy above science; it must be expunged and its victims remediated.\n\nReferences\n[1] White House, Presidential Actions — Executive Order 14270 (official text), “Zero‑Based Regulatory Budgeting to Unleash American Energy.” https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-zero-based-regulatory-budgeting-to-unleash-american-energy/\n[2] Federal Register, Presidential Documents — “Zero‑Based Regulatory Budgeting to Unleash American Energy” (publication of EO 14270). https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/02/12/2025-XXXXX/zero-based-regulatory-budgeting-to-unleash-american-energy\n[3] Reuters, coverage and analysis of EO 14270’s deregulatory implications. https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-signs-executive-order-zero-based-regulatory-budgeting-unleash-energy-2025-02-11/\n[4] E&E News, reporting on OMB authority and industry reaction to zero‑based regulatory budgets. https://www.eenews.net/articles/zero-based-regs-unleash-energy/\n[5] Environmental and public‑health impact analyses and commentary (aggregated reporting by environmental NGOs and public‑health researchers describing pollution and climate consequences following deregulatory rollbacks) — see major NGO briefings and technical comments linked from the EO docket at Regulations.gov and EPA‑related dockets.
