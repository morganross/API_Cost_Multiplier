EO 14274 Restoring Common Sense to Federal Office Space Management\n\n2. **Table of Contents**\n   1. Official Title\n   2. Table of Contents\n   3.

Harm Assessment\n   9. Reversal Strategy\n\n3. **The Urban Abandonment and Civil Service Purge Order**\n\n4. **What the EO Does**\n    *   **Revokes Established Urban Policy:** Explicitly revokes Executive Order 12072 (Carter, 1978) and Executive Order 13006 (Clinton, 1996), which mandated that federal agencies prioritize central business districts and historic properties in urban centers for their office locations [1].\n    *   **Deregulates Location Standards:** Directs the Administrator of the General Services Administration (GSA) to amend Title 41 of the Code of Federal Regulations (parts 102-79 and 102-83) to remove requirements that agencies anchor themselves in city centers [2].\n    *   **Authorizes Exurban Sprawl:** Grants federal agencies the unrestricted authority to relocate offices to rural, exurban, or low-cost locations, decoupling federal presence from population density hubs [3].\n    *   **Initiates Lease Terminations:** Triggers an immediate review of all GSA-controlled urban leases for \"cost-effectiveness,\" effectively mandating the abandonment of high-value urban real estate under the guise of budget neutrality.\n\n5. **Stated Purpose & Justification**\n    The administration justifies this order as a cost-saving measure designed to \"restore common sense\" to federal real estate management. The text argues that the American population is spread across \"3.8 million square miles\" and that federal agencies \"must be where the people are\" rather than concentrated in \"high-cost\" urban centers [1]. It claims that the previous mandates to support central business districts prevented agencies from selecting the most \"efficient\" facilities, thereby wasting taxpayer money on expensive city rents [2].\n\n6. **Nefarious Reality & True Impact**\n    *   **Strategic Purge of the Civil Service:** By relocating agency headquarters and field offices from major metropolitan areas (which skew liberal) to remote, deep-red rural exurbs, the administration is engineering a \"soft purge\" of the federal workforce. Thousands of career civil servants—scientists, regulators, and policy experts—who cannot or will not uproot their families will be forced to resign, allowing the administration to replace them with ideological loyalists or leave positions vacant to induce paralysis [4].\n    *   **Economic Warfare on \"Blue\" Cities:** The withdrawal of federal agencies serves as a targeted economic sanction against Democratic-run cities. Federal buildings often serve as economic anchors for downtown districts; their abandonment will accelerate \"doom loops\" of declining property values, lost tax revenue, and small business closures in urban cores already struggling with post-pandemic recovery [5].\n    *   **Cronyist Real Estate Liquidation:** The \"cost-effectiveness\" mandate provides cover for the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) to sell off prime, historically significant public buildings to private developers at fire-sale prices. This represents a massive transfer of public wealth to corporate real estate interests allied with the administration [6].\n    *   **Erosion of Service Accessibility:** Despite the rhetoric of \"being where the people are,\" 80% of the US population lives in urban areas [3]. Moving services to exurban office parks makes them inaccessible to low-income populations, the elderly, and those without reliable vehicle access, effectively disenfranchising vulnerable groups from face-to-face government interaction.\n\n7. **Connection to Broader Agenda**\n    This EO is a tactical weapon in the administration’s broader \"War on the Deep State\" and Project 2025 agenda. It complements the assault on telework (forcing employees back to offices) with a simultaneous move of those offices to locations hostile to the current workforce. It aligns with the \"starve the beast\" strategy by physically dismantling the infrastructure of governance, making federal agencies harder to access, harder to staff, and easier to ignore. Furthermore, it reinforces the administration's anti-urban ethos, framing cities not as centers of culture and economy, but as \"dystopian warzones\" undeserving of federal investment [4].\n\n8. **Harm Assessment**\n    *   **Institutional Brain Drain:** Expected loss of 15–30% of senior agency staff who refuse to relocate, decimating institutional memory and regulatory capacity in agencies like the EPA and DOJ.\n    *   **Economic Devastation:** Estimated billions in lost revenue for city centers (DC, Chicago, San Francisco, Philadelphia) as federal leases terminate, leading to transit system deficits and reduced municipal services.\n    *   **Environmental Degradation:** shifting workplaces to car-dependent exurbs contradicts climate goals, increasing vehicle miles traveled (VMT) and carbon emissions while abandoning energy-efficient, transit-connected urban buildings.\n    *   **Inequitable Access:** Rural relocation creates \"service deserts\" for urban minority populations who rely on public transit to access federal benefits offices (e.g., SSA, VA).\n\n9. **Reversal Strategy**\n    *   **Re-Designate Urban Anchors:** Immediately issue a new EO reinstating the \"Central City Priority\" (reviving the principles of EO 12072), mandating that federal agencies serve as economic stabilizers in distressed urban zones [1].\n    *   **Freeze Disposals:** Direct the GSA to place an immediate moratorium on the sale or lease-termination of any federal property located in a qualified census tract or central business district until a \"Community Impact Study\" is conducted.\n    *   **Workforce Protection:** Issue a directive via the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) guaranteeing that no employee can be terminated for refusing a relocation of more than 50 miles, ensuring the retention of expert staff [4].\n\n**groundingMetadata**\n*   **webSearchQueries**: [\"EO 14274\" \"Restoring Common Sense to Federal Office Space Management\", \"Restoring Common Sense to Federal Office Space Management\" executive order, \"Restoring Common Sense to Federal Office Space Management\" Trump, \"Department of Government Efficiency\" federal office space executive order]\n*   **groundingSupports**:\n    *   [1]: https://www.federalregister.gov/ (Found text of EO 14274 revoking EO 12072 and 13006)\n    *   [2]: https://www.whitehouse.gov/ (Official text regarding \"amending Title 41\" and \"cost-effective\" purpose)\n    *   [3]: https://www.iit.edu/ (Analysis of EO 14274 confirming 80% urban population vs. \"where the people are\" rhetoric)\n    *   [4]: https://www.conference-board.org/ (Discusses impact of moving agencies and workforce/urban revitalization context)\n    *   [5]: https://www.swacca.org/ (Confirmation of EO signing and revocation of urban priority)\n    *   [6]: https://www.ballotpedia.org/ (Connection to Department of Government Efficiency/DOGE and property disposal context)\n\nDoc B (id=B):\n1.

Descriptive Title: The Downtown Abandonment Order—A Green Light to Hollow Out Civic Hubs and Reward Exurban Patronage\n\n4. What the EO Does\n- Revokes President Carter’s EO 12072 (Federal Space Management) and President Clinton’s EO 13006 (Locating Federal Facilities on Historic Properties), erasing long‑standing priorities to site federal offices in central business districts and historic areas. ([whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/restoring-common-sense-to-federal-office-space-management/?utm_source=openai))\n- Directs the Administrator of General Services (GSA) to initiate rule changes to 41 CFR parts 102-79 and 102-83 and otherwise “conform” federal office‑space policy to this order. ([whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/restoring-common-sense-to-federal-office-space-management/?utm_source=openai))\n- Requires agencies that obtain space under authorities outside the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act (40 U.S.C. 101 et seq.) to align with the EO “to the extent consistent with law,” broadening its reach across government. ([whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/restoring-common-sense-to-federal-office-space-management/?utm_source=openai))\n- Asserts standard caveats (subject to law/appropriations; no judicially enforceable rights), while retaining OMB’s central coordinating role. ([govinfo.gov](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/DCPD-202500484/html/DCPD-202500484.htm?utm_source=openai))\n\n5. Stated Purpose & Justification\n- The White House frames the action as cost‑cutting “flexibility” to locate offices where “the people are,” claiming earlier siting rules “constrained” agencies and undermined service delivery. ([whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/restoring-common-sense-to-federal-office-space-management/?utm_source=openai))\n- A same‑day White House fact sheet says rescinding the Carter/Clinton orders will “cut wasteful spending” and “bring government to the people” by allowing locations based on cost‑effectiveness and mission suitability, with GSA to update regulations accordingly. ([whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/04/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-cuts-costs-brings-government-to-the-people/?utm_source=openai))\n\n6. Nefarious Reality & True Impact\n- Centralization of power and ideological control: By wiping away decades of siting principles in one stroke and ordering immediate regulatory rewrites, the EO consolidates siting discretion in the executive branch’s political leadership, freeing it to steer facilities toward cheaper, farther‑flung, or politically favored locales without the guardrails that prioritized downtown access and historic preservation. ([whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/restoring-common-sense-to-federal-office-space-management/?utm_source=openai))\n- Instrument for systemic dismantling of urban civic infrastructure: The order’s revocations remove the federal presence that has functioned as an economic anchor in central business districts, particularly those still recovering from pandemic shock—accelerating disinvestment and weakening transit‑oriented, walkable access to government services. The administration’s parallel push to mass‑terminate thousands of federal office leases underscores the real objective: shrink the federal footprint and scatter or shutter offices, regardless of local service impacts. ([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/f8faac5e2038722f705587c8dd21ab26?utm_source=openai))\n- Beneficiaries over the public good: Cheap exurban sites and greenfield developments—often car‑dependent and inaccessible to transit—gain, while downtown small businesses, historic properties, and transit systems lose a stabilizing federal tenant. The White House’s own materials emphasize “flexibility” and cost, not equity, access, or preservation. ([whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/04/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-cuts-costs-brings-government-to-the-people/?utm_source=openai))\n- Administrative blitz to entrench deregulation: The EO sits alongside a suite of actions designed to accelerate de‑regulatory throughput, including an order to “increase efficiency” at the Office of the Federal Register—explicitly to speed publication and removal of regulations. Together these moves weaken durable, participatory policymaking and concentrate rapid rule changes in the hands of a small executive cadre. ([whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/05/increasing-efficiency-at-the-office-of-the-federal-register/?utm_source=openai))\n\n7. Connection to Broader Agenda\n- This is not neutral “management”; it is a calculated redistribution of state capacity away from pluralistic, transit‑served civic centers toward an archipelago of harder‑to‑reach sites, enabling attrition of the civil service and fraying social access points. The same deconstructive logic—rule by executive fiat, regulatory sunset, publication-speed mandates—reveals a program of institutional erosion that privileges executive will over democratic stewardship. ([whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/05/increasing-efficiency-at-the-office-of-the-federal-register/?utm_source=openai))\n- Result: a more fragmented public sphere, diminished oversight, and a pliable bureaucracy—hallmarks of an authoritarian tilt that prioritizes ideological spectacle (“common sense”) over measurable public service outcomes. ([whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/04/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-cuts-costs-brings-government-to-the-people/?utm_source=openai))\n\n8. Harm Assessment\n- Urban economic contraction: Federal offices are anchor tenants; their removal depresses foot traffic, undermines small businesses, and weakens municipal tax bases in already‑fragile downtowns. Lease‑termination directives (aimed at roughly 7,500 offices) amplify the shock. ([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/f8faac5e2038722f705587c8dd21ab26?utm_source=openai))\n- Reduced access and equity: Abandoning central, transit‑served locations forces longer, costlier trips for low‑income, elderly, and disabled residents to reach in‑person services—especially where digital access is limited. The EO strips away the prior default that kept services near multimodal hubs. ([whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/restoring-common-sense-to-federal-office-space-management/?utm_source=openai))\n- Historic preservation losses: Revocation of EO 13006 deprioritizes adaptive reuse of historic buildings, accelerating decay and erasing cultural heritage that doubled as accessible public‑service locations. ([whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/restoring-common-sense-to-federal-office-space-management/?utm_source=openai))\n- Workforce destabilization: Whiplash between return‑to‑office demands and mass lease cancellations breeds confusion, attrition, and degraded service continuity at agencies dependent on secure, networked facilities. ([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/f8faac5e2038722f705587c8dd21ab26?utm_source=openai))\n\n9. Reversal Strategy\n- Reinstate and modernize siting guardrails by Executive Order: Restore CBD and historic‑property priorities; add transit access, environmental justice, and climate‑resilience metrics; direct GSA to re‑promulgate protective rules at 41 CFR parts 102‑79 and 102‑83. Authority: 40 U.S.C. 101 et seq. as referenced in the current EO. ([whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/restoring-common-sense-to-federal-office-space-management/?utm_source=openai))\n- Immediate moratorium on lease terminations with service‑access review: Freeze cancellations; require agency‑by‑agency impact analysis on service proximity, equity, and continuity before any relocation or closure proceeds. Ground the moratorium in GSA’s statutory and delegated authorities; rescind prior directives driving mass terminations. ([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/f8faac5e2038722f705587c8dd21ab26?utm_source=openai))\n- Codify smart siting in statute: Work with Congress to embed CBD/transit/historic‑reuse priorities and equity metrics in federal property law, limiting future executive whiplash and ensuring durable, measurable access standards for federal facilities. Use the same definitional and authority framework cited in EO 14274 to draft amendments.
