Once high‑value buildings are sold or long‑leased to private actors, reacquisition becomes politically and financially prohibitive—a one‑way ratchet toward permanent privatization.  \n   - This is not hypothetical. The administration has already used “efficiency” tools to orchestrate mass RIF planning through the Department of Government Efficiency initiative and EO 14210, with federal courts finding that the White House attempted an unlawful, centralized dismantling of agency capacity masked as routine reorganizations.[^justsecurity-rif] EO 14274 weaponizes the real‑estate side of the same project.\n\n2. **Enabling Schedule F–style politicization by hollowing out workplaces**\n\n   - Schedule F / “Schedule Policy‑Career” is explicitly about stripping tens of thousands of civil servants of due‑process protections and making them at‑will employees[^govexec-schedulef][^timetrex]. That effort requires both legal mechanisms and environmental pressure.  \n   - Office‑space consolidation functions as that pressure: shuttered offices and “hot‑desking” make it easier to push out disfavored staff, centralize remaining employees into politically controlled hubs, and justify terminations as “space‑driven RIFs” rather than ideological purges.  \n   - As Democracy Forward and others have documented, the broader Trump civil‑service program—new Schedule F, mass RIFs, and loyalty‑screening “Merit Hiring Plan”—is designed to replace merit‑based staff with loyalists.[^democracyforward] EO 14274 quietly complements this by **eliminating the physical infrastructure that sustains independent professional cultures** in dispersed field offices.\n\n3. **Strategic abandonment of communities and oversight**\n\n   - Closing or consolidating regional and field offices is not a neutral efficiency tweak; it is a deliberate withdrawal of federal presence from communities where that presence is an implicit check on local abuses—environmental, labor, civil‑rights, and corporate.  \n   - We’ve already seen Trump use executive power and litigation to erode enforcement: EO 14147 (“Ending the Weaponization of the Federal Government”) orders an aggressive review of DOJ, SEC, and FTC enforcement actions with an eye toward disciplining or curbing “weaponization.”[^weaponization] Shrinking their office footprints and scattering their staff exacerbates that chilling effect.  \n   - Legal analysis of Trump’s RIF and reorganization strategy underscores that the ultimate goal is to **restructure agencies so they cannot carry out their statutory mandates** without explicit White House blessing.[^justsecurity-rif] EO 14274 gives that strategy a bricks‑and‑mortar dimension.\n\n4. **Quiet boon to private real‑estate and corporate interests**\n\n   - The order’s push to unload or re‑lease prime federal buildings in Washington, D.C., and major metros becomes a windfall for favored developers and contractors, especially in a political climate already rife with cronyism.  \n   - Once agencies are pushed into leased, privately owned facilities, they become **permanent tenants of the donor class** rather than stewards of public assets. This shift deepens plutocratic entrenchment: public money flows as rent to politically connected landlords instead of into durable public infrastructure.\n\n5. **Curtailing unions and internal dissent**\n\n   - Space is power. For unions and whistleblowers, physical proximity sustains organizing and solidarity. EO 14274’s consolidation and hot‑desking undermine that, especially in tandem with Trump’s union‑busting executive orders that force termination of collective bargaining agreements at national security‑adjacent agencies and restrict federal‑employee unions under the guise of “national security.”[^ballotpedia-unions]  \n   - A more atomized, remote workforce is easier to intimidate and surveil and harder to mobilize, which is precisely the environment that Project 2025 and allied think tanks envision when they promote Schedule F as a tool to “dismantle the deep state.”[^kettering]\n\n---\n\n7. **Connection to Broader Agenda**\n\nEO 14274 does not stand alone; it is a cog in an integrated authoritarian machinery:\n\n- **Civil‑service capture and purges.**  \n  - EO 14274’s space mandates interact with Schedule F / Schedule Policy‑Career and RIF‑driven reorganizations to create a multi‑front attack: reclassify or fire protected employees, then close or consolidate their workplaces so rebuilding a non‑partisan corps becomes logistically impossible.[^govexec-schedulef][^timetrex][^justsecurity-rif]  \n  - This is reinforced by hiring rules that inject ideological screening into ostensibly “merit‑based” recruitment.[^protectdemocracy]\n\n- **Crippling judicial and administrative checks.**  \n  - The Supreme Court’s decision in *Trump v. CASA, Inc.* has already eliminated nationwide injunctions, severely weakening the ability of courts to freeze unlawful executive actions across the country.[^casa-arnoldporter] That means EO 14274 can devastate one region even while litigation slowly unfolds elsewhere—no broad shield, only piecemeal relief.  \n  - The same Court has curtailed deference to agency expertise and signaled skepticism toward robust judicial review in immigration and asylum cases, feeding a jurisprudential climate that favors executive “management” over statutory fidelity.\n\n- **Authoritarian consolidation through “efficiency.”**  \n  - The Department of Government Efficiency EO explicitly orders agencies to design RIF and reorganization plans to “sweepingly reform the federal government,” targeting positions seen as ideologically hostile.[^opm-dge] EO 14274 is the physical template for that restructuring.  \n  - Kettering’s analysis of Schedule F warns that it is “one of the most significant challenges to the structure and principles of the American federal civil service since the Pendleton Act,” enabling a spoils system in which loyalty trumps competence.[^kettering] A gutted, centralized office footprint is crucial for such a patronage state.\n\n- **Erosion of safety nets and regulatory protections.**  \n  - Less physical presence means weaker enforcement of labor standards, environmental laws, consumer protections, and civil rights—especially in rural and marginalized communities that rely on in‑person access.  \n  - This dovetails with Trump’s broader policies: draconian immigration enforcement, FTO over‑designations of political movements, and mass deportation campaigns all require a weakened civil‑rights and oversight infrastructure to proceed with minimal internal resistance.\n\nIn combination, these moves amount to a **systemic dismantling of liberal‑democratic guardrails** under the sanitized banner of “common‑sense office management.”\n\n---\n\n8. **Harm Assessment**\n\nTangible harms from EO 14274, especially when layered with other Trump initiatives:\n\n1. **Service degradation for vulnerable populations**\n\n   - Rural Social Security, VA, HUD, and USDA clients already suffer from office closures and under‑staffing that predate this administration. Accelerated closures and consolidations will increase travel times, digital‑access barriers, and delays for seniors, disabled people, veterans, low‑income tenants, and farmers.  \n   - Empirically, reductions in field presence correlate with reduced benefits uptake and weaker enforcement; similar trends are documented when immigration and labor offices are shuttered or centralized.\n\n2. **Loss of public‑sector jobs and localized economic damage**\n\n   - RIF planning tied to office‑space cuts threatens tens of thousands of federal jobs, often in communities where federal facilities are anchor employers.[^govexec-rifs][^justsecurity-rif]  \n   - These layoffs disproportionately affect Black, Brown, and unionized workers who are over‑represented in certain agencies and regions, deepening racialized inequality.\n\n3. **Diminished oversight of corporations and corruption**\n\n   - Fewer investigators, auditors, and inspectors physically present in regions where environmental and labor abuses are concentrated translates directly into more pollution, wage theft, and unsafe workplaces.  \n   - Trump’s firing of Inspectors General and efforts to terminate union contracts at enforcement‑heavy agencies are part of the same trend of disabling watchdogs and emboldening corporate malfeasance.[^townhall-igs][^ballotpedia-unions]\n\n4. **Entrenchment of privatization and plutocratic control**\n\n   - Disposed federal real estate in central business districts becomes a playground for developers; long‑term leases keep agencies hostage to corporate landlords. Over time, this undermines democratic control over the physical spaces of governance and directs public funds into private profit streams.\n\n5. **Chilling effect on dissent and whistleblowing**\n\n   - Dispersed telework, hot‑desking, and the closure of union offices make it harder to build trust networks that sustain whistleblowers and resisters. Coupled with at‑will Schedule F conversions and loyalty‑screened hiring, employees face a stark choice: silence, exit, or retaliation.\n\n---\n\n9. **Reversal Strategy**\n\nTo undo EO 14274’s damage and rebuild capacity, the next administration should:\n\n1. **Rescind EO 14274 immediately and freeze all related disposals and consolidations.**  \n   - Issue a new executive order revoking 14274, suspending any pending office closures, sales, or lease terminations initiated under its authority, and directing GSA to inventory and, where feasible, reacquire or re‑establish public control over critical facilities.  \n   - Model the rescission on Biden’s prior revocation of Schedule F (EO 14003) and pair it with clear guidance restoring pre‑Trump space‑planning norms.\n\n2. **Legislate guardrails for federal real‑estate and civil‑service protection.**  \n   - Push for a **Federal Public Infrastructure Protection Act** that:  \n     - Requires congressional authorization for disposal of significant federal buildings or closures of key field offices.  \n     - Codifies limits on Schedule F–type reclassifications and prohibits using space decisions as de facto personnel purges.  \n   - Build on existing legislative efforts like the Saving the Civil Service Act and union‑backed reforms to shield merit‑based employment.[^nffe][^kettering]\n\n3. **Rebuild and democratize federal presence in communities.**  \n   - Launch a multi‑year “Federal Presence Restoration Program” prioritizing re‑establishment and expansion of field offices for agencies with direct public‑facing missions—SSA, VA, DOL, EEOC, EPA, USDA, HUD—particularly in underserved and heavily deregulated regions.  \n   - Mandate genuine consultation with unions, community organizations, and state/local governments in siting decisions, and tie restoration funding to strong civil‑service protections and anti‑retaliation provisions for employees who resisted Trump‑era purges.\n\n---\n\n[^govexec-schedulef]: Government Executive, “Final Schedule F regulations to describe civil service protections as ‘unconstitutional overcorrections’,” Nov. 18, 2025. https://www.govexec.com/workforce/2025/11/final-schedule-f-regulations-describe-civil-service-protections-unconstitutional-overcorrections/409616/  \n[^timetrex]: TimeTrex, “OPM Schedule F 2025: An Analysis of Federal Workforce Reform,” Apr. 23, 2025. https://www.timetrex.com/blog/opm-schedule-f  \n[^democracyforward]: Democracy Forward, “Trump Administration’s Attempt to Override Civil Service Protections is Unlawful,” Apr. 22, 2025. https://democracyforward.org/updates/schedule-f-042225/  \n[^kettering]: Kettering Foundation, “The Schedule F Threat to Democracy: A Project 2025 Explainer,” Aug. 6, 2024. https://kettering.org/the-schedule-f-threat-to-democracy-a-project-2025-explainer/  \n[^weaponization]: Federal Register, “Ending the Weaponization of the Federal Government,” EO 14147, 90 Fed.

This mirrors rhetoric in Trump’s “Unleashing Prosperity Through Deregulation” and “Commencing the Reduction of the Federal Bureaucracy” EOs, which cast deep structural cuts as mere tidying‑up exercises.[^ncsl][^ncsl-reduce]  \n- **Post‑Pandemic Utilization Logic:** It leans heavily on the real phenomenon of underused office buildings after COVID‑era telework, arguing that “restoring common sense” means aligning space with “modern workforce patterns.”  \n- **“Government Efficiency” and “Accountability”:** In line with the February 2025 “Department of Government Efficiency” initiative, the order is sold as streamlining overlapping functions, eliminating “waste and bloat,” and “modernizing” federal facilities management to mirror private sector practices.[^dge]  \n- **Environmental & Urbanist Cover Rhetoric:** There are likely passing references to reducing energy usage and avoiding “empty downtowns” by “releasing unnecessary federal holdings” back to the private market—turning legitimate concerns about vacant buildings into justifications for permanent state retrenchment.  \n\nThe official narrative is that EO 14274 is a neutral, technocratic, good‑governance initiative that will “save money, cut red tape, and modernize outdated office patterns.”\n\n---\n\n6. **Nefarious Reality & True Impact**\n\nBehind the anodyne title and vacuous managerial jargon, EO 14274 is a **deliberate infrastructure of dismantling**—a spatial strategy for shrinking the capacity of the federal government, undermining unions, and gifting public assets to the administration’s corporate allies.\n\n### 6.1. Structural Downsizing Disguised as “Space Management”\n\nThe order weaponizes real estate policy to advance the White House’s explicit goal of “commencing the reduction of the federal bureaucracy,”[^ncsl-reduce] turning facilities planning into a purge mechanism:\n\n- Once a program loses its dedicated physical space, its staff are easier to scatter, furlough, or quietly abolish.  \n- Agency leaders hostile to specific missions—civil-rights enforcement, environmental protection, workplace safety, consumer finance oversight—are handed a powerful tool: declare offices “underutilized,” then shutter them.  \n- The myth of “remote‑first government” is deployed to sever localized, community‑facing federal presence, especially in places where vulnerable communities depend on walk‑in access.\n\nThis mirrors broader authoritarian playbooks: **starve and displace the administrative apparatus until public protections become impossible in practice, even if they technically exist on paper.**\n\n### 6.2. Centralization of Power in the Executive\n\nBy funneling decisions about “essential space” and “strategic consolidation” through OMB and politically‑appointed White House staff, EO 14274:\n\n- Erodes agency autonomy and professional judgment by career experts.  \n- Allows the President’s inner circle to punish disfavored agencies (e.g., EPA, DOJ Civil Rights Division, OSHA, CFPB) through physical dislocation and attrition.  \n- Reinforces a pattern already visible in this administration’s approach to DEI bans, curriculum control (“Ending Radical Indoctrination in K‑12 Schooling”), and broad deregulation: re‑centralize authority in the executive and its ideologues, then **govern by demolition**.[^ncsl-di][^ncsl-k12]\n\n### 6.3. Capture and Looting of Public Assets\n\nConsolidation and “disposal” of federal buildings, particularly in high‑value urban cores, inevitably opens the door to:\n\n- **Below‑market sales and sweetheart leases** to politically connected real‑estate and private equity firms.  \n- Conversion of once‑public civic anchors into luxury offices, condos, or speculative assets, accelerating gentrification while erasing visible symbols of the federal presence.  \n\nThe order thereby serves as a **quiet privatization scheme**, shifting long‑term public wealth into private hands—an archetypal plutocratic move dressed up as thrift.\n\n### 6.4. Attack on Unions and Worker Power\n\nFederal buildings are not neutral shells; they are loci of workplace rights:\n\n- Consolidation and hot‑desking undermine negotiated space standards, privacy, and accommodations for disabled workers.  \n- Forced relocations and regional office closures destabilize bargaining units and fracture organizing efforts.  \n- “Telework as austerity” increases surveillance and precarity; management can more easily reclassify, outsource, or abolish remote positions.\n\nThe Holland & Knight tracking of 2025 Trump orders already notes how this administration is systematically using executive power to decimate worker protections and entitlements in adjacent domains.[^hk]\n\n### 6.5. Selective Targeting of Particular Missions\n\nWhile the EO uses generic language about utilization and efficiency, **not all square footage is equal** in the eyes of this regime. It dovetails with clear ideological targets:\n\n- **Climate and environmental enforcement:** Already under direct assault via “Putting America First in International Environmental Agreements” and aggressive deregulation of energy and extraction.[^ncsl-environment] Office closures at EPA regional and field locations directly reduce inspection capacity, oversight of oil and gas operations, and enforcement of Clean Air/Water Act rules.  \n- **Civil rights, DEI, and anti‑discrimination work:** The January 2025 EO “Ending Radical and Wasteful Government DEI Programs and Preferencing” explicitly attacks equity infrastructure; reducing office footprints in civil-rights units compounds that gutting, hobbling investigations into discrimination in housing, education, policing, and employment.[^dei]  \n- **Independent and quasi‑independent oversight bodies:** Inspectors General, watchdog offices, and specialized investigative units lose secure, independent space—making them easier to monitor, marginalize, or quietly suffocate.\n\nWhen combined with the administration’s push to treat left‑leaning nonprofits as “domestic terrorism networks” and to weaponize IRS investigations against critics,[^demdoc][^nbc] the pattern is unmistakable: **physical infrastructure is being rearranged to reward loyalists and punish adversaries.**\n\n---\n\n7. **Connection to Broader Agenda**\n\nEO 14274 is not a quirk of facilities management; it is a brick in a larger authoritarian architecture.\n\n### 7.1. Eroding the Administrative State as a Precondition for Authoritarian Rule\n\nThe Trump administration’s 2025 executive‑order spree—withdrawal from global health cooperation, dismantling AI safeguards, terminating DEI, shrinking the bureaucracy, empowering domestic political crackdowns—maps directly onto a strategy to **disable democratic governance so that only the strongman remains.**[^ncsl][^hk][^dei]\n\nWhen the regulatory, investigative, and service‑delivery arms of the state are:\n\n- scattered into remote work silos;  \n- stripped of their physical bases; and  \n- denied the stability of long‑term, publicly owned infrastructure,\n\nthey become far less capable of restraining executive abuse, corporate predation, or right‑wing vigilantism.\n\n### 7.2. Plutocratic Entrenchment and Anti‑Public Urbanism\n\nPublic buildings are often the last major non‑market anchors in downtowns and regional hubs: courthouses, Social Security offices, VA facilities, regulatory field offices.\n\nBy liquidating or abandoning these spaces, EO 14274:\n\n- further cedes city centers to finance, luxury real estate, and surveillance‑oriented tech;  \n- sidelines poor, disabled, and elderly residents who rely on proximity to services;  \n- enshrines a geometry of power where physical access to state institutions is a privilege mediated by travel, technology, and private gatekeepers.\n\nThis is not “common sense”; it is the **spatialization of class rule**.\n\n### 7.3. Complementing the Crackdown on Dissent\n\nThe same administration is simultaneously:\n\n- floating and implementing measures to label antifa and left‑leaning nonprofits as “domestic terrorism networks,” directing DOJ, Treasury, IRS, and FBI to go after them;[^demdoc][^guardian]  \n- preparing IRS‑CI changes aimed at investigating left‑leaning groups and donors, especially those connected to George Soros and progressive foundations;[^foxbiz]  \n- and tolerating, if not encouraging, disproportionate surveillance and prosecution of anti‑Trump protest networks, as documented by CSIS and civil‑liberties groups.[^csis][^guardian]\n\nShrinking the neutral, local physical presence of the federal government while expanding the national‑security/surveillance machinery produces a distorted state: **hard and punitive toward dissent, absent and anemic toward social needs.** EO 14274 fits that blueprint exactly.\n\n---\n\n8. **Harm Assessment**\n\nBecause EO 14274 acts through infrastructure, much of its damage will be **long‑term, slow‑burn, and hard to reverse**—precisely its strategic value to the administration.\n\n### 8.1. Communities & Vulnerable Populations\n\n- **Reduced access to services:** Closure or consolidation of Social Security, VA, immigration, HUD, labor, and USDA field offices forces people—especially rural, elderly, disabled, and low‑income residents—to travel farther, navigate digital systems, or rely on intermediaries to access benefits. Research has repeatedly shown that such “friction” reduces program take‑up and deepens poverty.  \n- **Disparate racial impact:** Black, Latino, Native, and immigrant communities are disproportionately reliant on in‑person assistance due to historical underinvestment in infrastructure, language barriers, and digital divides. Contraction of federal footprints compounds the discriminatory impact of other Trump EOs attacking DEI and civil‑rights enforcement.[^dei]  \n\n### 8.2. Workers and Institutional Capacity\n\n- **Job losses and attrition:** Even without an overt RIF (reduction in force), disappearing office space and forced relocations push experienced civil servants into early retirement or resignation, draining institutional memory and expertise.  \n- **Burnout and diminished oversight:** Remaining staff are overloaded, remote, and further from communities and regulated entities; oversight visits, inspections, and investigations decline in frequency and depth.  \n\nThe net effect is **de facto deregulation**: rules technically remain, but enforcement withers.\n\n### 8.3. Environmental and Public‑Health Risks\n\n- Fewer staffed regional hubs at EPA, OSHA, MSHA, and related agencies mean slower responses to spills, industrial accidents, air and water contamination, and workplace disasters.  \n- Industry gains more leverage to self‑police, particularly given the administration’s aggressive pro‑fossil‑fuel orders—lifting gas export bans, opening ANWR, and reversing offshore drilling protections.[^wh-promises]  \n\nCommunities already on the frontlines of pollution bear the brunt as the government physically abandons their regions.\n\n### 8.4. Democratic Legitimacy and Public Trust\n\nPublic buildings are **symbols** as much as instruments of democracy. Their closure or conversion signals:\n\n- that the federal government is retreating from everyday life;  \n- that contact with the state is mediated through punitive systems (police, immigration raids, surveillance) rather than supportive ones (benefits, rights, protections).\n\nThis deepens cynicism and despair, which the administration then weaponizes as proof that “government doesn’t work,” justifying yet more dismantling—a vicious feedback loop.\n\n---\n\n9. **Reversal Strategy**\n\nTo undo the damage of EO 14274 and prevent similar abuses, the next progressive administration should pursue a three‑pronged approach.\n\n### 9.1. Immediate Legal Reversal and Moratorium\n\n- **Action:** Issue an early‑day executive order explicitly revoking EO 14274 and any implementing guidance or OMB/GSA memoranda. Impose an immediate moratorium on federal building sales, major lease terminations, and office closures initiated under the Trump order.  \n- **Rationale:** Stop the hemorrhaging of public assets and prevent additional closures before a full impact review.  \n- **Reference:** Past practice shows incoming presidents routinely rescind harmful predecessors’ EOs in bulk; NCSL tracks such rescissions as a standard governance tool.[^ncsl]\n\n### 9.2. Rebuild and Democratize Federal Physical Presence\n\n- **Action:** Launch a “Public Infrastructure for Democracy” initiative to:  \n  - restore closed regional and field offices in key agencies (EPA, DOJ Civil Rights, OSHA, SSA, VA, HUD, CFPB);  \n  - prioritize community‑based service centers in underserved neighborhoods;  \n  - embed robust disability access, multilingual support, and union consultation in all facilities planning.  \n- **Rationale:** Re‑materialize the state as a protective, accessible presence and repair the damage to enforcement capacity and service delivery.  \n- **Reference:** Models can draw on New Deal and Great Society precedents for federally funded civic infrastructure, including courthouses, post offices, and service centers.\n\n### 9.3. Statutory Guardrails on Politicized Real‑Estate Downsizing\n\n- **Action:** Work with Congress to pass legislation that:  \n  - requires independent, public-interest‑driven impact assessments and public hearings before major office closures or disposals;  \n  - mandates GAO review of large federal property sales and prohibits transfer to entities with conflicts of interest or substantial political donations to sitting presidents;  \n  - guarantees collective‑bargaining rights in any facilities restructuring and protects against using telework as a backdoor justification for attrition.  \n- **Rationale:** Remove real‑estate policy from the toolbox of future authoritarian administrations and lock in a pro‑public, anti‑corruption framework.  \n- **Reference:** Similar oversight and transparency principles are outlined in GAO guidance and good‑governance recommendations from organizations like the Project On Government Oversight (POGO) and the Brennan Center.\n\n---\n\n[^ncsl]: National Conference of State Legislatures, “2025 Administration Actions: Key Executive Orders and Policies,” summarizing major Trump 2025 EOs including government‑reduction and deregulation actions: https://www.ncsl.org/in-dc/2025-administration-actions-key-executive-orders-and-policies  \n\n[^ncsl-reduce]: Ibid., “Commencing the Reduction of the Federal Bureaucracy,” Feb. 19, 2025 (executive order targeting elimination of non‑statutory components and functions).  \n\n[^dge]: The White House, “Implementing The President’s ‘Department of Government Efficiency’ Workforce Optimization Initiative,” Feb. 11, 2025: https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/02/implementing-the-presidents-department-of-government-efficiency-workforce-optimization-initiative/  \n\n[^ncsl-di]: NCSL summary of “Delivering Emergency Price Relief for American Families and Defeating the Cost-of-Living Crisis,” “Unleashing Prosperity Through Deregulation,” and related 2025 Trump EOs: https://www.ncsl.org/in-dc/2025-administration-actions-key-executive-orders-and-policies  \n\n[^ncsl-k12]: NCSL, “Ending Radical Indoctrination in K‑12 Schooling,” Jan. 29, 2025: https://www.ncsl.org/in-dc/2025-administration-actions-key-executive-orders-and-policies  \n\n[^dei]: The White House, “Ending Radical And Wasteful Government DEI Programs And Preferencing,” Jan. 20, 2025: https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/ending-radical-and-wasteful-government-dei-programs-and-preferencing/  \n\n[^hk]: Holland & Knight, “Trump’s 2025 Executive Orders Chart,” tracking major Trump 2025 EOs across policy domains: https://www.hklaw.com/en/general-pages/trumps-2025-executive-orders-chart  \n\n[^ncsl-environment]: NCSL, “Putting America First in International Environmental Agreements,” Jan. 20, 2025: https://www.ncsl.org/in-dc/2025-administration-actions-key-executive-orders-and-policies  \n\n[^demdoc]: Democracy Docket, “In Dangerous Attack on Left-Leaning Nonprofits, Trump Orders Government to Go After ‘Domestic Terrorism Networks’,” Sept. 25, 2025: https://www.democracydocket.com/news-alerts/trump-order-terrorism-network-left-leaning-nonprofits/  \n\n[^guardian]: The Guardian, “Trump signs memo targeting ‘domestic terrorism’ amid fears of crackdown on the left,” Sept. 25, 2025: https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/25/trump-presidential-memorandum-political-violence  \n\n[^foxbiz]: Fox Business, “Trump administration plans IRS changes for criminal investigations,” discussing plans to enable IRS‑CI probes of left‑leaning groups and donors: https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/trump-admin-plans-irs-overhaul-probe-left-leaning-groups-more-easily-wsj-reports  \n\n[^nbc]: NBC News, “White House plans to take action targeting left-wing groups as early as this month,” Sept. 17, 2025: https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/white-house-plans-take-action-targeting-left-wing-groups-early-month-rcna231998  \n\n[^csis]: Center for Strategic and International Studies, “Left-Wing Terrorism and Political Violence in the United States: What the Data Tells Us,” 2025: https://www.csis.org/analysis/left-wing-terrorism-and-political-violence-united-states-what-data-tells-us  \n\n[^wh-promises]: The White House, “✅ Promises Made, Promises Kept — One Year Later,” Nov. 5, 2025 (energy and deregulation sections): https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/11/promises-made-promises-kept-one-year-later/\n\n\nPairwise evaluation payload placeholder."
