It:\n\n- **Revokes two cornerstone siting orders.** It explicitly rescinds President Carter’s EO 12072 (“Federal Space Management”) and President Clinton’s EO 13006 (“Locating Federal Facilities on Historic Properties in Our Nation’s Central Cities”), which for decades required agencies to give first consideration to central business districts and historic properties in central cities when siting federal offices. ([archives.gov](https://www.archives.gov/federal-register/codification/executive-order/12072.html?utm_source=openai))  \n\n- **Abolishes federal preference for downtown and historic locations.** By eliminating 12072 and 13006, it removes any government‑wide obligation to strengthen central cities, support historic districts, or anchor transit‑rich downtowns with federal employment and services, replacing those goals with a vague “cost‑effective facilities” standard. ([whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/restoring-common-sense-to-federal-office-space-management/?utm_source=openai))  \n\n- **Delegates implementation to GSA and broadens the order’s reach.** It directs the Administrator of General Services to amend federal space‑management regulations at 41 C.F.R. Parts 102‑79 and 102‑83 and to “take any other steps necessary” so that federal policy conforms to the new, deregulated siting regime. The order also instructs agencies that acquire or use space under authorities outside the main federal property statute to conform “to the extent consistent with applicable law,” pulling in as many entities as possible. ([whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/restoring-common-sense-to-federal-office-space-management/?utm_source=openai))  \n\n- **Includes boilerplate non‑enforcement language.** Standard clauses clarify that the order creates no judicially enforceable rights and must be implemented subject to appropriations—classic language used across this administration’s EOs to insulate sweeping policy shifts from direct legal challenge. ([presidency.ucsb.edu](https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/executive-order-14274-restoring-common-sense-federal-office-space-management?utm_source=openai))  \n\nIn substance, EO 14274 is a surgical demolition of the urban‑revitalization and historic‑preservation priorities that had governed federal office siting since the late 1970s.  \n\n---\n\n### Stated Purpose & Justification\n\nOfficially, the administration presents EO 14274 as a common‑sense, taxpayer‑friendly modernization:\n\n- **Framing: “government where the people are.”** The order opens by noting that Americans live across 3.8 million square miles and asserts that, to provide efficient, cost‑effective service, federal agencies “must be where the people are,” implying that earlier urban siting rules prevented agencies from following their constituencies. ([whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/restoring-common-sense-to-federal-office-space-management/?utm_source=openai))  \n\n- **Attack on Carter and Clinton policies.** The EO claims Carter’s 12072, which required first consideration for central business districts, has “prevented agencies from relocating to lower‑cost facilities,” and that Clinton’s 13006, encouraging use of historic properties in central cities, “failed to adequately prioritize efficient and effective Government service.” Revoking both is said to “restore common sense” by freeing agencies to prioritize cost and mission over location constraints. ([whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/restoring-common-sense-to-federal-office-space-management/?utm_source=openai))  \n\n- **White House messaging: cutting waste and bringing government to the people.** A contemporaneous White House fact sheet touts EO 14274 as “restoring flexibility” in office space, “cutting wasteful spending,” and letting agencies choose locations based on cost‑effectiveness, mission, and “the needs of the American people,” framed as breaking loose from “unnecessary” restrictions favoring central business districts and historic downtowns. ([whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/04/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-cuts-costs-brings-government-to-the-people/?utm_source=openai))  \n\n- **Technical codification.** FedCenter and other compliance resources summarize the order as revoking 12072 and 13006 to allow agencies to select cost‑effective facilities “in urban, suburban, or rural areas,” underscoring that locational equity goals have been replaced by sheer cost criteria. ([fedcenter.gov](https://www.fedcenter.gov/programs/compliance/executiveorders/?utm_source=openai))  \n\nIn short, the official justification is an efficiency narrative: taxpayer savings, flexibility, and better alignment with a geographically dispersed public. Urban and historic‑preservation rationales are rebranded as obsolete constraints.  \n\n---\n\n### Nefarious Reality & True Impact\n\nBehind the “common sense” branding, EO 14274 is a targeted dismantling of three intertwined pillars of democratic governance: **urban revitalization, historic preservation, and locally accountable federal presence.**  \n\n#### 1. Tearing Out the Urban & Historic Mandate\n\nCarter’s EO 12072 directed that federal facilities in urban areas should *strengthen cities*, make downtowns attractive places to work, and prioritize central business areas, explicitly tying space policy to social, economic, and environmental impacts and requiring consultation with local governments. ([archives.gov](https://www.archives.gov/federal-register/codification/executive-order/12072.html?utm_source=openai))  \n\nClinton’s EO 13006 went further: when operationally appropriate and economically prudent, agencies were to give **first consideration** to historic properties and districts—especially in central business areas—as part of broader efforts to revitalize central cities and fulfill the National Historic Preservation Act. ([achp.gov](https://www.achp.gov/digital-library-section-106-landing/locating-federal-facilities-historic-properties-our-nations?utm_source=openai))  \n\nEO 14274 does not replace these commitments; it **simply removes them.** After April 15, 2025, there is no government‑wide requirement to:\n\n- Prefer transit‑accessible central business districts over exurban office parks;  \n- Use federal tenancy as an anchor for downtown jobs, small businesses, and mixed‑use redevelopment;  \n- Integrate historic‑preservation and community‑revitalization goals into location decisions; or  \n- Formally consult with city and regional governments about the social and environmental impacts of federal siting choices.\n\nThe decision rule is reduced to “cost‑effective facilities,” a textbook case of **pseudo‑technocratic austerity**: numbers in a spreadsheet displacing decades of democratically articulated urban and preservation policy.  \n\n#### 2. Legal Cover for a Fire Sale of Urban Public Assets\n\nEO 14274 lands in the middle of an aggressive, highly centralized campaign to shrink the federal real‑estate footprint, overseen by the General Services Administration (GSA) in collaboration with the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) and Elon Musk’s inner circle.\n\n- In early 2025, GSA published—then hastily removed—a list of 443 “non‑core” federal properties flagged for possible sale, including prominent downtown buildings and key headquarters, as part of a DOGE‑led initiative to reduce maintenance costs via asset disposal. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-takes-down-list-federal-properties-possible-sale-2025-03-05/?utm_source=openai))  \n\n- AP reporting describes internal GSA directives, driven by Trump, Musk, and DOGE, to begin terminating leases on approximately 7,500 federal offices nationwide—hundreds of cancellations in nearly all states and territories, affecting agencies from the IRS and Bureau of Indian Affairs to health service centers and labor offices. ([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/f8faac5e2038722f705587c8dd21ab26?utm_source=openai))  \n\n- DOGE’s own lease‑termination claims have been repeatedly walked back. After trumpeting 793 canceled leases and $500 million in savings, DOGE quietly removed 136 leases from its list and cut claimed savings by $150 million, with scant explanation from GSA—underscoring the opacity and unreliability of the “efficiency” metrics being wielded to justify closures. ([businessinsider.com](https://www.businessinsider.com/doge-reduces-savings-claimed-from-ending-leases-150-million-2025-3?utm_source=openai))  \n\nEO 14274 provides a **crucial legal foundation** for this campaign. By revoking 12072 and 13006, it removes the strongest arguments local officials and preservation advocates had to resist federal abandonment of downtown and historic properties. Where GSA previously had to justify moving out of central business districts and historic districts against explicit presidential directives, it can now invoke EO 14274 to insist that cost and mission alone control, with no affirmative downtown preference to balance against.\n\nWe already see the consequences:\n\n- In San Antonio, GSA has designated a historic federal complex with Social Security and probation offices as “excess” and is expediting its sale as part of a real‑estate downsizing push. Local reporting notes that redevelopment prospects are tied to a planned sports and entertainment district—classic handover of a public anchor to private speculation. ([mysanantonio.com](https://www.mysanantonio.com/business/article/doge-cuts-san-antonio-cesar-chavez-20270675.php?utm_source=openai))  \n\nThe logic is ruthless but straightforward: **extract short‑term cash and paper “savings” from selling and vacating public urban assets, and let cities, tenants, and vulnerable communities absorb the fallout.**  \n\n#### 3. Centralization of Power, Disempowerment of Communities\n\nIronically, while the order claims to “bring government to the people,” it **centralizes control over federal space in Washington and within a narrow ideological network**:\n\n- 12072 required GSA to consider not only federal mission and cost, but also local social, economic, and environmental impacts—and to consult state, regional, and local officials before final site decisions. ([archives.gov](https://www.archives.gov/federal-register/codification/executive-order/12072.html?utm_source=openai)) EO 14274 leaves those consultation norms without a federal‑wide anchor, relegating community and local government voices to afterthoughts in a process dominated by GSA, OMB, and DOGE.  \n\n- By forcing agencies operating under other statutory authorities to “conform” to the new policy, the EO tries to eliminate pockets of autonomy—sweeping in entities (from independent commissions to specialized services) that previously could use their own authorities to maintain urban or historic presence despite GSA pressure. ([presidency.ucsb.edu](https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/executive-order-14274-restoring-common-sense-federal-office-space-management?utm_source=openai))  \n\nCombined, this is **not** decentralization; it is a consolidation of strategic control over where the federal state physically exists—ceding enormous leverage to a White House allied with developers, fossil‑fuel interests, and anti‑state ideologues, while stripping away the protective legal architecture cities and preservationists have relied on for nearly half a century.  \n\n---\n\n### Connection to Broader Agenda\n\nEO 14274 is one tile in a larger mosaic of Trump’s second‑term campaign to **hollow out the federal state under the banner of “common sense,” “efficiency,” and “putting Americans first.”**\n\n- On March 14, 2025, the “Continuing the Reduction of the Federal Bureaucracy” order instructed multiple agencies—ranging from the Interagency Council on Homelessness to the Minority Business Development Agency—to eliminate non‑statutory functions and shrink even mandated services to the bare legal minimum, with OMB directed to reject funding inconsistent with that liquidation agenda. ([whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/continuing-the-reduction-of-the-federal-bureaucracy/?utm_source=openai))  \n\n- In April 2025 alone, Trump signed a cluster of “Restoring Common Sense” EOs: 14271 on “commercial, cost‑effective solutions” in federal contracts and 14275 on “Restoring Common Sense to Federal Procurement,” both aimed at stripping non‑statutory safeguards out of the Federal Acquisition Regulation and prioritizing off‑the‑shelf commercial products. ([local10.com](https://www.local10.com//news/politics/2025/02/20/the-list-executive-orders-signed-in-2025-by-president-donald-trump/?utm_source=openai))  \n\n- FedCenter’s executive‑order tracker shows these 2025 orders interlocking with resource‑extraction and deregulatory moves, such as EO 14225 ordering an “immediate expansion” of American timber production and EO 14270’s “Zero‑Based Regulatory Budgeting to Unleash American Energy,” systematically subordinating environmental and community protections to extraction and corporate convenience. ([fedcenter.gov](https://www.fedcenter.gov/programs/compliance/executiveorders/?utm_source=openai))  \n\nWithin this architecture:\n\n- **EO 14274 weakens the physical and symbolic presence of the federal government in diverse, transit‑served, politically pluralistic downtowns**, making it easier to move agencies into ideologically aligned suburban and exurban strongholds, or to scatter them into isolated campuses largely invisible to civic scrutiny.  \n\n- Coupled with mass lease cancellations and DOGE‑driven workforce reductions, it contributes to a broader strategy of **state shrinkage without democratic debate**: dismantling public capacities and institutions piece by piece via administrative fiat, while insulating these moves with boilerplate “no rights created” language.  \n\nThe pattern is unmistakable: a **proto‑authoritarian re‑engineering of the state** in which regulatory power, public‑facing services, and urban civic anchors are intentionally weakened, while coercive and extractive capacities (policing, immigration enforcement, military, fossil‑fuel and timber development) are preserved or strengthened.  \n\n---\n\n### Harm Assessment\n\nThe harms of EO 14274 are multifaceted, slow‑burning, and cumulative. They will not be fully visible for years—but they are already emerging.\n\n#### 1. Urban Disinvestment and Historic Erasure\n\nBy removing federal preference for central business districts and historic properties, the EO:\n\n- **Accelerates disinvestment in already fragile downtowns.** Federal agencies are often among the largest, most stable downtown tenants. Their departure hollows out daytime populations, undermines small businesses, and weakens commercial tax bases precisely when many downtowns are struggling post‑pandemic. Carter and Clinton explicitly harnessed federal tenancy to support urban revitalization; Trump’s order breaks that linkage. ([wbdg.org](https://www.wbdg.org/fed/executive-orders/eo-12072?utm_source=openai))  \n\n- **Undermines historic‑preservation policy.** EO 13006 linked federal siting to the National Historic Preservation Act, encouraging acquisition and reuse of historic buildings. Without that preference, historically significant but maintenance‑intensive buildings are prime candidates for disposal, demolition, or luxury conversion, as in San Antonio’s case. ([achp.gov](https://www.achp.gov/digital-library-section-106-landing/locating-federal-facilities-historic-properties-our-nations?utm_source=openai))  \n\nThe likely result is a **wave of heritage loss and luxury redevelopment**, with public buildings that embodied civic presence converted into high‑end hotels, entertainment districts, or speculative office towers—enriching developers while erasing collective memory and democratic symbolism.  \n\n#### 2. Harm to Vulnerable Populations and Public Services\n\nMass lease terminations and relocations, enabled and normalized by EO 14274’s cost‑first logic, disproportionately hit agencies that serve the most vulnerable:\n\n- AP reporting shows terminations affecting Social Security offices, health‑service centers, Bureau of Indian Affairs facilities, and Department of Labor sites across nearly every state and territory. ([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/2b19594b17bb66cfc3122dd82c5663b8?utm_source=openai))  \n\n- Even when services are nominally relocated rather than eliminated, they are increasingly pushed to cheaper, less accessible sites—often auto‑dependent locations far from transit, walkable neighborhoods, or tribal communities, making it harder for seniors, disabled people, low‑income workers, and Native communities to access in‑person assistance.\n\nThis is **a quiet form of structural violence**: the people least able to navigate digital bureaucracy or travel long distances are the first to lose convenient access to federal help.  \n\n#### 3. Environmental Degradation and Climate Backsliding\n\nThe Carter and Clinton frameworks were early federal attempts to align space policy with **sustainable urbanism**: concentrating offices in existing downtowns, using infrastructure efficiently, and reducing sprawl. ([wbdg.org](https://www.wbdg.org/fed/executive-orders/eo-12072?utm_source=openai))  \n\nBy contrast, EO 14274:\n\n- Removes incentives to co‑locate near transit or in walkable districts;  \n- Encourages dispersal into cheaper exurban office parks and greenfield sites; and  \n- Facilitates disposal of centrally located buildings in favor of new construction elsewhere.\n\nIn climate terms, this pushes the federal footprint toward **longer commutes, higher vehicle miles traveled, and higher per‑capita emissions**, directly cutting against smart‑growth and climate‑justice strategies that rely on dense, transit‑served employment centers.  \n\n#### 4. Democratic and Institutional Erosion\n\nFinally, there is the less visible but profound democratic harm:\n\n- **Physical distance from scrutiny.** Moving major functions out of central, media‑rich, advocacy‑dense cities makes it harder for journalists, unions, NGOs, and local officials to monitor agencies and organize workers.  \n\n- **Demoralization and attrition of the civil service.** Constant uncertainty about office closures, forced relocations, and lease terminations—based on opaque DOGE “savings” numbers—pushes experienced staff to retire or leave for the private sector, weakening institutional memory and the capacity to resist unlawful or unethical directives. ([businessinsider.com](https://www.businessinsider.com/doge-reduces-savings-claimed-from-ending-leases-150-million-2025-3?utm_source=openai))  \n\n- **Disempowerment of local governments.** With the revocation of 12072 and 13006, cities lose formal leverage in federal siting decisions, shifting power upward to GSA and the White House. This further entrenches a **top‑down, extractive model of governance** in which communities are acted upon, not engaged.  \n\nThe net effect is a more brittle, less accountable federal presence—one that serves as a pliant instrument of executive will rather than a distributed network of institutions embedded in and responsive to local democratic life.  \n\n---\n\n### Reversal Strategy\n\nTo undo the damage of EO 14274, a future administration should pursue a coordinated strategy of **immediate executive reversal, rigorous repair, and durable statutory reform.**\n\n1. **Issue a replacement EO on “Equitable Federal Facility Location and Historic Preservation.”**  \n   - On Day One, revoke EO 14274 and promulgate a new order that reinstates and modernizes the core principles of EO 12072 and EO 13006: first consideration for central business districts and historic properties, mandatory consultation with local and tribal governments, explicit integration of environmental justice and climate criteria, and transit‑accessibility requirements grounded in existing statutory authorities such as the National Historic Preservation Act and 40 U.S.C. § 3306. ([achp.gov](https://www.achp.gov/digital-library-section-106-landing/locating-federal-facilities-historic-properties-our-nations?utm_source=openai))  \n\n2. **Impose a moratorium and audit on space disposals and lease terminations driven by EO 14274/DOGE.**  \n   - Direct GSA and OMB to halt further lease cancellations, disposals, and major relocations initiated under the “common sense” framework pending a full audit of their fiscal claims and community impacts, with priority to restoring or relocating core public‑facing services—especially Social Security, BIA, health, and labor offices—to accessible, transit‑served urban and reservation locations. ([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/2b19594b17bb66cfc3122dd82c5663b8?utm_source=openai))  \n\n3. **Codify equitable siting principles in statute to prevent future executive sabotage.**  \n   - Work with Congress to amend 40 U.S.C. § 3306 and related provisions to embed requirements that federal facilities prioritize central cities, historic properties, transit access, and environmental‑justice communities, with enforceable consultation and impact‑analysis procedures and a clear role for the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation—ensuring that any future president cannot, with a single pen stroke, re‑weaponize federal space policy against cities, history, and vulnerable populations. ([law.cornell.edu](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/40/3306?utm_source=openai))  \n\nTaken together, these steps would not only roll back EO 14274 but also **rebuild a more resilient, equitable, and democratically grounded framework** for federal office space—one that treats public buildings not as disposable balance‑sheet entries, but as critical infrastructure for a multi‑racial democracy and a livable planet.\n\nDoc B (id=B):\n1.

Descriptive Title: The Downtown Abandonment Order—A Green Light to Hollow Out Civic Hubs and Reward Exurban Patronage\n\n4. What the EO Does\n- Revokes President Carter’s EO 12072 (Federal Space Management) and President Clinton’s EO 13006 (Locating Federal Facilities on Historic Properties), erasing long‑standing priorities to site federal offices in central business districts and historic areas. ([whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/restoring-common-sense-to-federal-office-space-management/?utm_source=openai))\n- Directs the Administrator of General Services (GSA) to initiate rule changes to 41 CFR parts 102-79 and 102-83 and otherwise “conform” federal office‑space policy to this order. ([whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/restoring-common-sense-to-federal-office-space-management/?utm_source=openai))\n- Requires agencies that obtain space under authorities outside the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act (40 U.S.C. 101 et seq.) to align with the EO “to the extent consistent with law,” broadening its reach across government. ([whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/restoring-common-sense-to-federal-office-space-management/?utm_source=openai))\n- Asserts standard caveats (subject to law/appropriations; no judicially enforceable rights), while retaining OMB’s central coordinating role. ([govinfo.gov](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/DCPD-202500484/html/DCPD-202500484.htm?utm_source=openai))\n\n5. Stated Purpose & Justification\n- The White House frames the action as cost‑cutting “flexibility” to locate offices where “the people are,” claiming earlier siting rules “constrained” agencies and undermined service delivery. ([whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/restoring-common-sense-to-federal-office-space-management/?utm_source=openai))\n- A same‑day White House fact sheet says rescinding the Carter/Clinton orders will “cut wasteful spending” and “bring government to the people” by allowing locations based on cost‑effectiveness and mission suitability, with GSA to update regulations accordingly. ([whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/04/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-cuts-costs-brings-government-to-the-people/?utm_source=openai))\n\n6. Nefarious Reality & True Impact\n- Centralization of power and ideological control: By wiping away decades of siting principles in one stroke and ordering immediate regulatory rewrites, the EO consolidates siting discretion in the executive branch’s political leadership, freeing it to steer facilities toward cheaper, farther‑flung, or politically favored locales without the guardrails that prioritized downtown access and historic preservation. ([whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/restoring-common-sense-to-federal-office-space-management/?utm_source=openai))\n- Instrument for systemic dismantling of urban civic infrastructure: The order’s revocations remove the federal presence that has functioned as an economic anchor in central business districts, particularly those still recovering from pandemic shock—accelerating disinvestment and weakening transit‑oriented, walkable access to government services. The administration’s parallel push to mass‑terminate thousands of federal office leases underscores the real objective: shrink the federal footprint and scatter or shutter offices, regardless of local service impacts. ([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/f8faac5e2038722f705587c8dd21ab26?utm_source=openai))\n- Beneficiaries over the public good: Cheap exurban sites and greenfield developments—often car‑dependent and inaccessible to transit—gain, while downtown small businesses, historic properties, and transit systems lose a stabilizing federal tenant. The White House’s own materials emphasize “flexibility” and cost, not equity, access, or preservation. ([whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/04/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-cuts-costs-brings-government-to-the-people/?utm_source=openai))\n- Administrative blitz to entrench deregulation: The EO sits alongside a suite of actions designed to accelerate de‑regulatory throughput, including an order to “increase efficiency” at the Office of the Federal Register—explicitly to speed publication and removal of regulations. Together these moves weaken durable, participatory policymaking and concentrate rapid rule changes in the hands of a small executive cadre. ([whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/05/increasing-efficiency-at-the-office-of-the-federal-register/?utm_source=openai))\n\n7. Connection to Broader Agenda\n- This is not neutral “management”; it is a calculated redistribution of state capacity away from pluralistic, transit‑served civic centers toward an archipelago of harder‑to‑reach sites, enabling attrition of the civil service and fraying social access points. The same deconstructive logic—rule by executive fiat, regulatory sunset, publication-speed mandates—reveals a program of institutional erosion that privileges executive will over democratic stewardship. ([whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/05/increasing-efficiency-at-the-office-of-the-federal-register/?utm_source=openai))\n- Result: a more fragmented public sphere, diminished oversight, and a pliable bureaucracy—hallmarks of an authoritarian tilt that prioritizes ideological spectacle (“common sense”) over measurable public service outcomes. ([whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/04/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-cuts-costs-brings-government-to-the-people/?utm_source=openai))\n\n8. Harm Assessment\n- Urban economic contraction: Federal offices are anchor tenants; their removal depresses foot traffic, undermines small businesses, and weakens municipal tax bases in already‑fragile downtowns. Lease‑termination directives (aimed at roughly 7,500 offices) amplify the shock. ([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/f8faac5e2038722f705587c8dd21ab26?utm_source=openai))\n- Reduced access and equity: Abandoning central, transit‑served locations forces longer, costlier trips for low‑income, elderly, and disabled residents to reach in‑person services—especially where digital access is limited. The EO strips away the prior default that kept services near multimodal hubs. ([whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/restoring-common-sense-to-federal-office-space-management/?utm_source=openai))\n- Historic preservation losses: Revocation of EO 13006 deprioritizes adaptive reuse of historic buildings, accelerating decay and erasing cultural heritage that doubled as accessible public‑service locations. ([whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/restoring-common-sense-to-federal-office-space-management/?utm_source=openai))\n- Workforce destabilization: Whiplash between return‑to‑office demands and mass lease cancellations breeds confusion, attrition, and degraded service continuity at agencies dependent on secure, networked facilities. ([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/f8faac5e2038722f705587c8dd21ab26?utm_source=openai))\n\n9. Reversal Strategy\n- Reinstate and modernize siting guardrails by Executive Order: Restore CBD and historic‑property priorities; add transit access, environmental justice, and climate‑resilience metrics; direct GSA to re‑promulgate protective rules at 41 CFR parts 102‑79 and 102‑83. Authority: 40 U.S.C. 101 et seq. as referenced in the current EO. ([whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/restoring-common-sense-to-federal-office-space-management/?utm_source=openai))\n- Immediate moratorium on lease terminations with service‑access review: Freeze cancellations; require agency‑by‑agency impact analysis on service proximity, equity, and continuity before any relocation or closure proceeds. Ground the moratorium in GSA’s statutory and delegated authorities; rescind prior directives driving mass terminations. ([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/f8faac5e2038722f705587c8dd21ab26?utm_source=openai))\n- Codify smart siting in statute: Work with Congress to embed CBD/transit/historic‑reuse priorities and equity metrics in federal property law, limiting future executive whiplash and ensuring durable, measurable access standards for federal facilities. Use the same definitional and authority framework cited in EO 14274 to draft amendments.
