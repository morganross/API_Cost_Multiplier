Harm Assessment\n   9. Reversal Strategy\n\n3. **The Urban Abandonment and Civil Service Purge Order**\n\n4. **What the EO Does**\n    *   **Revokes Established Urban Policy:** Explicitly revokes Executive Order 12072 (Carter, 1978) and Executive Order 13006 (Clinton, 1996), which mandated that federal agencies prioritize central business districts and historic properties in urban centers for their office locations [1].\n    *   **Deregulates Location Standards:** Directs the Administrator of the General Services Administration (GSA) to amend Title 41 of the Code of Federal Regulations (parts 102-79 and 102-83) to remove requirements that agencies anchor themselves in city centers [2].\n    *   **Authorizes Exurban Sprawl:** Grants federal agencies the unrestricted authority to relocate offices to rural, exurban, or low-cost locations, decoupling federal presence from population density hubs [3].\n    *   **Initiates Lease Terminations:** Triggers an immediate review of all GSA-controlled urban leases for \"cost-effectiveness,\" effectively mandating the abandonment of high-value urban real estate under the guise of budget neutrality.\n\n5. **Stated Purpose & Justification**\n    The administration justifies this order as a cost-saving measure designed to \"restore common sense\" to federal real estate management. The text argues that the American population is spread across \"3.8 million square miles\" and that federal agencies \"must be where the people are\" rather than concentrated in \"high-cost\" urban centers [1]. It claims that the previous mandates to support central business districts prevented agencies from selecting the most \"efficient\" facilities, thereby wasting taxpayer money on expensive city rents [2].\n\n6. **Nefarious Reality & True Impact**\n    *   **Strategic Purge of the Civil Service:** By relocating agency headquarters and field offices from major metropolitan areas (which skew liberal) to remote, deep-red rural exurbs, the administration is engineering a \"soft purge\" of the federal workforce. Thousands of career civil servants—scientists, regulators, and policy experts—who cannot or will not uproot their families will be forced to resign, allowing the administration to replace them with ideological loyalists or leave positions vacant to induce paralysis [4].\n    *   **Economic Warfare on \"Blue\" Cities:** The withdrawal of federal agencies serves as a targeted economic sanction against Democratic-run cities. Federal buildings often serve as economic anchors for downtown districts; their abandonment will accelerate \"doom loops\" of declining property values, lost tax revenue, and small business closures in urban cores already struggling with post-pandemic recovery [5].\n    *   **Cronyist Real Estate Liquidation:** The \"cost-effectiveness\" mandate provides cover for the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) to sell off prime, historically significant public buildings to private developers at fire-sale prices. This represents a massive transfer of public wealth to corporate real estate interests allied with the administration [6].\n    *   **Erosion of Service Accessibility:** Despite the rhetoric of \"being where the people are,\" 80% of the US population lives in urban areas [3]. Moving services to exurban office parks makes them inaccessible to low-income populations, the elderly, and those without reliable vehicle access, effectively disenfranchising vulnerable groups from face-to-face government interaction.\n\n7. **Connection to Broader Agenda**\n    This EO is a tactical weapon in the administration’s broader \"War on the Deep State\" and Project 2025 agenda. It complements the assault on telework (forcing employees back to offices) with a simultaneous move of those offices to locations hostile to the current workforce. It aligns with the \"starve the beast\" strategy by physically dismantling the infrastructure of governance, making federal agencies harder to access, harder to staff, and easier to ignore. Furthermore, it reinforces the administration's anti-urban ethos, framing cities not as centers of culture and economy, but as \"dystopian warzones\" undeserving of federal investment [4].\n\n8. **Harm Assessment**\n    *   **Institutional Brain Drain:** Expected loss of 15–30% of senior agency staff who refuse to relocate, decimating institutional memory and regulatory capacity in agencies like the EPA and DOJ.\n    *   **Economic Devastation:** Estimated billions in lost revenue for city centers (DC, Chicago, San Francisco, Philadelphia) as federal leases terminate, leading to transit system deficits and reduced municipal services.\n    *   **Environmental Degradation:** shifting workplaces to car-dependent exurbs contradicts climate goals, increasing vehicle miles traveled (VMT) and carbon emissions while abandoning energy-efficient, transit-connected urban buildings.\n    *   **Inequitable Access:** Rural relocation creates \"service deserts\" for urban minority populations who rely on public transit to access federal benefits offices (e.g., SSA, VA).\n\n9. **Reversal Strategy**\n    *   **Re-Designate Urban Anchors:** Immediately issue a new EO reinstating the \"Central City Priority\" (reviving the principles of EO 12072), mandating that federal agencies serve as economic stabilizers in distressed urban zones [1].\n    *   **Freeze Disposals:** Direct the GSA to place an immediate moratorium on the sale or lease-termination of any federal property located in a qualified census tract or central business district until a \"Community Impact Study\" is conducted.\n    *   **Workforce Protection:** Issue a directive via the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) guaranteeing that no employee can be terminated for refusing a relocation of more than 50 miles, ensuring the retention of expert staff [4].\n\n**groundingMetadata**\n*   **webSearchQueries**: [\"EO 14274\" \"Restoring Common Sense to Federal Office Space Management\", \"Restoring Common Sense to Federal Office Space Management\" executive order, \"Restoring Common Sense to Federal Office Space Management\" Trump, \"Department of Government Efficiency\" federal office space executive order]\n*   **groundingSupports**:\n    *   [1]: https://www.federalregister.gov/ (Found text of EO 14274 revoking EO 12072 and 13006)\n    *   [2]: https://www.whitehouse.gov/ (Official text regarding \"amending Title 41\" and \"cost-effective\" purpose)\n    *   [3]: https://www.iit.edu/ (Analysis of EO 14274 confirming 80% urban population vs. \"where the people are\" rhetoric)\n    *   [4]: https://www.conference-board.org/ (Discusses impact of moving agencies and workforce/urban revitalization context)\n    *   [5]: https://www.swacca.org/ (Confirmation of EO signing and revocation of urban priority)\n    *   [6]: https://www.ballotpedia.org/ (Connection to Department of Government Efficiency/DOGE and property disposal context)\n\nDoc B (id=B):\n**[Official Title]**  \nEO 14274 Restoring Common Sense to Federal Office Space Management  \n\n---\n\n**Table of Contents**\n\n- [Official Title]  \n- Table of Contents  \n- [Descriptive Title]  \n- What the EO Does  \n- Stated Purpose & Justification  \n- Nefarious Reality & True Impact  \n- Connection to Broader Agenda  \n- Harm Assessment  \n- Reversal Strategy  \n\n---\n\n**[Descriptive Title]**  \nEO 14274: The Downtown Divestment Order and Blueprint for Abandoning Cities, History, and Public Accountability  \n\n---\n\n### What the EO Does\n\nFactually, EO 14274 is short but far‑reaching. It:\n\n- **Revokes two cornerstone siting orders.** It explicitly rescinds President Carter’s EO 12072 (“Federal Space Management”) and President Clinton’s EO 13006 (“Locating Federal Facilities on Historic Properties in Our Nation’s Central Cities”), which for decades required agencies to give first consideration to central business districts and historic properties in central cities when siting federal offices. ([archives.gov](https://www.archives.gov/federal-register/codification/executive-order/12072.html?utm_source=openai))  \n\n- **Abolishes federal preference for downtown and historic locations.** By eliminating 12072 and 13006, it removes any government‑wide obligation to strengthen central cities, support historic districts, or anchor transit‑rich downtowns with federal employment and services, replacing those goals with a vague “cost‑effective facilities” standard. ([whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/restoring-common-sense-to-federal-office-space-management/?utm_source=openai))  \n\n- **Delegates implementation to GSA and broadens the order’s reach.** It directs the Administrator of General Services to amend federal space‑management regulations at 41 C.F.R. Parts 102‑79 and 102‑83 and to “take any other steps necessary” so that federal policy conforms to the new, deregulated siting regime. The order also instructs agencies that acquire or use space under authorities outside the main federal property statute to conform “to the extent consistent with applicable law,” pulling in as many entities as possible. ([whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/restoring-common-sense-to-federal-office-space-management/?utm_source=openai))  \n\n- **Includes boilerplate non‑enforcement language.** Standard clauses clarify that the order creates no judicially enforceable rights and must be implemented subject to appropriations—classic language used across this administration’s EOs to insulate sweeping policy shifts from direct legal challenge. ([presidency.ucsb.edu](https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/executive-order-14274-restoring-common-sense-federal-office-space-management?utm_source=openai))  \n\nIn substance, EO 14274 is a surgical demolition of the urban‑revitalization and historic‑preservation priorities that had governed federal office siting since the late 1970s.  \n\n---\n\n### Stated Purpose & Justification\n\nOfficially, the administration presents EO 14274 as a common‑sense, taxpayer‑friendly modernization:\n\n- **Framing: “government where the people are.”** The order opens by noting that Americans live across 3.8 million square miles and asserts that, to provide efficient, cost‑effective service, federal agencies “must be where the people are,” implying that earlier urban siting rules prevented agencies from following their constituencies. ([whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/restoring-common-sense-to-federal-office-space-management/?utm_source=openai))  \n\n- **Attack on Carter and Clinton policies.** The EO claims Carter’s 12072, which required first consideration for central business districts, has “prevented agencies from relocating to lower‑cost facilities,” and that Clinton’s 13006, encouraging use of historic properties in central cities, “failed to adequately prioritize efficient and effective Government service.” Revoking both is said to “restore common sense” by freeing agencies to prioritize cost and mission over location constraints. ([whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/restoring-common-sense-to-federal-office-space-management/?utm_source=openai))  \n\n- **White House messaging: cutting waste and bringing government to the people.** A contemporaneous White House fact sheet touts EO 14274 as “restoring flexibility” in office space, “cutting wasteful spending,” and letting agencies choose locations based on cost‑effectiveness, mission, and “the needs of the American people,” framed as breaking loose from “unnecessary” restrictions favoring central business districts and historic downtowns. ([whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/04/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-cuts-costs-brings-government-to-the-people/?utm_source=openai))  \n\n- **Technical codification.** FedCenter and other compliance resources summarize the order as revoking 12072 and 13006 to allow agencies to select cost‑effective facilities “in urban, suburban, or rural areas,” underscoring that locational equity goals have been replaced by sheer cost criteria. ([fedcenter.gov](https://www.fedcenter.gov/programs/compliance/executiveorders/?utm_source=openai))  \n\nIn short, the official justification is an efficiency narrative: taxpayer savings, flexibility, and better alignment with a geographically dispersed public. Urban and historic‑preservation rationales are rebranded as obsolete constraints.  \n\n---\n\n### Nefarious Reality & True Impact\n\nBehind the “common sense” branding, EO 14274 is a targeted dismantling of three intertwined pillars of democratic governance: **urban revitalization, historic preservation, and locally accountable federal presence.**  \n\n#### 1. Tearing Out the Urban & Historic Mandate\n\nCarter’s EO 12072 directed that federal facilities in urban areas should *strengthen cities*, make downtowns attractive places to work, and prioritize central business areas, explicitly tying space policy to social, economic, and environmental impacts and requiring consultation with local governments. ([archives.gov](https://www.archives.gov/federal-register/codification/executive-order/12072.html?utm_source=openai))  \n\nClinton’s EO 13006 went further: when operationally appropriate and economically prudent, agencies were to give **first consideration** to historic properties and districts—especially in central business areas—as part of broader efforts to revitalize central cities and fulfill the National Historic Preservation Act. ([achp.gov](https://www.achp.gov/digital-library-section-106-landing/locating-federal-facilities-historic-properties-our-nations?utm_source=openai))  \n\nEO 14274 does not replace these commitments; it **simply removes them.** After April 15, 2025, there is no government‑wide requirement to:\n\n- Prefer transit‑accessible central business districts over exurban office parks;  \n- Use federal tenancy as an anchor for downtown jobs, small businesses, and mixed‑use redevelopment;  \n- Integrate historic‑preservation and community‑revitalization goals into location decisions; or  \n- Formally consult with city and regional governments about the social and environmental impacts of federal siting choices.\n\nThe decision rule is reduced to “cost‑effective facilities,” a textbook case of **pseudo‑technocratic austerity**: numbers in a spreadsheet displacing decades of democratically articulated urban and preservation policy.  \n\n#### 2. Legal Cover for a Fire Sale of Urban Public Assets\n\nEO 14274 lands in the middle of an aggressive, highly centralized campaign to shrink the federal real‑estate footprint, overseen by the General Services Administration (GSA) in collaboration with the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) and Elon Musk’s inner circle.\n\n- In early 2025, GSA published—then hastily removed—a list of 443 “non‑core” federal properties flagged for possible sale, including prominent downtown buildings and key headquarters, as part of a DOGE‑led initiative to reduce maintenance costs via asset disposal. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-takes-down-list-federal-properties-possible-sale-2025-03-05/?utm_source=openai))  \n\n- AP reporting describes internal GSA directives, driven by Trump, Musk, and DOGE, to begin terminating leases on approximately 7,500 federal offices nationwide—hundreds of cancellations in nearly all states and territories, affecting agencies from the IRS and Bureau of Indian Affairs to health service centers and labor offices. ([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/f8faac5e2038722f705587c8dd21ab26?utm_source=openai))  \n\n- DOGE’s own lease‑termination claims have been repeatedly walked back. After trumpeting 793 canceled leases and $500 million in savings, DOGE quietly removed 136 leases from its list and cut claimed savings by $150 million, with scant explanation from GSA—underscoring the opacity and unreliability of the “efficiency” metrics being wielded to justify closures. ([businessinsider.com](https://www.businessinsider.com/doge-reduces-savings-claimed-from-ending-leases-150-million-2025-3?utm_source=openai))  \n\nEO 14274 provides a **crucial legal foundation** for this campaign. By revoking 12072 and 13006, it removes the strongest arguments local officials and preservation advocates had to resist federal abandonment of downtown and historic properties. Where GSA previously had to justify moving out of central business districts and historic districts against explicit presidential directives, it can now invoke EO 14274 to insist that cost and mission alone control, with no affirmative downtown preference to balance against.\n\nWe already see the consequences:\n\n- In San Antonio, GSA has designated a historic federal complex with Social Security and probation offices as “excess” and is expediting its sale as part of a real‑estate downsizing push. Local reporting notes that redevelopment prospects are tied to a planned sports and entertainment district—classic handover of a public anchor to private speculation. ([mysanantonio.com](https://www.mysanantonio.com/business/article/doge-cuts-san-antonio-cesar-chavez-20270675.php?utm_source=openai))  \n\nThe logic is ruthless but straightforward: **extract short‑term cash and paper “savings” from selling and vacating public urban assets, and let cities, tenants, and vulnerable communities absorb the fallout.**  \n\n#### 3. Centralization of Power, Disempowerment of Communities\n\nIronically, while the order claims to “bring government to the people,” it **centralizes control over federal space in Washington and within a narrow ideological network**:\n\n- 12072 required GSA to consider not only federal mission and cost, but also local social, economic, and environmental impacts—and to consult state, regional, and local officials before final site decisions. ([archives.gov](https://www.archives.gov/federal-register/codification/executive-order/12072.html?utm_source=openai)) EO 14274 leaves those consultation norms without a federal‑wide anchor, relegating community and local government voices to afterthoughts in a process dominated by GSA, OMB, and DOGE.  \n\n- By forcing agencies operating under other statutory authorities to “conform” to the new policy, the EO tries to eliminate pockets of autonomy—sweeping in entities (from independent commissions to specialized services) that previously could use their own authorities to maintain urban or historic presence despite GSA pressure. ([presidency.ucsb.edu](https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/executive-order-14274-restoring-common-sense-federal-office-space-management?utm_source=openai))  \n\nCombined, this is **not** decentralization; it is a consolidation of strategic control over where the federal state physically exists—ceding enormous leverage to a White House allied with developers, fossil‑fuel interests, and anti‑state ideologues, while stripping away the protective legal architecture cities and preservationists have relied on for nearly half a century.  \n\n---\n\n### Connection to Broader Agenda\n\nEO 14274 is one tile in a larger mosaic of Trump’s second‑term campaign to **hollow out the federal state under the banner of “common sense,” “efficiency,” and “putting Americans first.”**\n\n- On March 14, 2025, the “Continuing the Reduction of the Federal Bureaucracy” order instructed multiple agencies—ranging from the Interagency Council on Homelessness to the Minority Business Development Agency—to eliminate non‑statutory functions and shrink even mandated services to the bare legal minimum, with OMB directed to reject funding inconsistent with that liquidation agenda. ([whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/continuing-the-reduction-of-the-federal-bureaucracy/?utm_source=openai))  \n\n- In April 2025 alone, Trump signed a cluster of “Restoring Common Sense” EOs: 14271 on “commercial, cost‑effective solutions” in federal contracts and 14275 on “Restoring Common Sense to Federal Procurement,” both aimed at stripping non‑statutory safeguards out of the Federal Acquisition Regulation and prioritizing off‑the‑shelf commercial products. ([local10.com](https://www.local10.com//news/politics/2025/02/20/the-list-executive-orders-signed-in-2025-by-president-donald-trump/?utm_source=openai))  \n\n- FedCenter’s executive‑order tracker shows these 2025 orders interlocking with resource‑extraction and deregulatory moves, such as EO 14225 ordering an “immediate expansion” of American timber production and EO 14270’s “Zero‑Based Regulatory Budgeting to Unleash American Energy,” systematically subordinating environmental and community protections to extraction and corporate convenience. ([fedcenter.gov](https://www.fedcenter.gov/programs/compliance/executiveorders/?utm_source=openai))  \n\nWithin this architecture:\n\n- **EO 14274 weakens the physical and symbolic presence of the federal government in diverse, transit‑served, politically pluralistic downtowns**, making it easier to move agencies into ideologically aligned suburban and exurban strongholds, or to scatter them into isolated campuses largely invisible to civic scrutiny.  \n\n- Coupled with mass lease cancellations and DOGE‑driven workforce reductions, it contributes to a broader strategy of **state shrinkage without democratic debate**: dismantling public capacities and institutions piece by piece via administrative fiat, while insulating these moves with boilerplate “no rights created” language.  \n\nThe pattern is unmistakable: a **proto‑authoritarian re‑engineering of the state** in which regulatory power, public‑facing services, and urban civic anchors are intentionally weakened, while coercive and extractive capacities (policing, immigration enforcement, military, fossil‑fuel and timber development) are preserved or strengthened.  \n\n---\n\n### Harm Assessment\n\nThe harms of EO 14274 are multifaceted, slow‑burning, and cumulative. They will not be fully visible for years—but they are already emerging.\n\n#### 1. Urban Disinvestment and Historic Erasure\n\nBy removing federal preference for central business districts and historic properties, the EO:\n\n- **Accelerates disinvestment in already fragile downtowns.** Federal agencies are often among the largest, most stable downtown tenants. Their departure hollows out daytime populations, undermines small businesses, and weakens commercial tax bases precisely when many downtowns are struggling post‑pandemic. Carter and Clinton explicitly harnessed federal tenancy to support urban revitalization; Trump’s order breaks that linkage. ([wbdg.org](https://www.wbdg.org/fed/executive-orders/eo-12072?utm_source=openai))  \n\n- **Undermines historic‑preservation policy.** EO 13006 linked federal siting to the National Historic Preservation Act, encouraging acquisition and reuse of historic buildings. Without that preference, historically significant but maintenance‑intensive buildings are prime candidates for disposal, demolition, or luxury conversion, as in San Antonio’s case. ([achp.gov](https://www.achp.gov/digital-library-section-106-landing/locating-federal-facilities-historic-properties-our-nations?utm_source=openai))  \n\nThe likely result is a **wave of heritage loss and luxury redevelopment**, with public buildings that embodied civic presence converted into high‑end hotels, entertainment districts, or speculative office towers—enriching developers while erasing collective memory and democratic symbolism.  \n\n#### 2. Harm to Vulnerable Populations and Public Services\n\nMass lease terminations and relocations, enabled and normalized by EO 14274’s cost‑first logic, disproportionately hit agencies that serve the most vulnerable:\n\n- AP reporting shows terminations affecting Social Security offices, health‑service centers, Bureau of Indian Affairs facilities, and Department of Labor sites across nearly every state and territory. ([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/2b19594b17bb66cfc3122dd82c5663b8?utm_source=openai))  \n\n- Even when services are nominally relocated rather than eliminated, they are increasingly pushed to cheaper, less accessible sites—often auto‑dependent locations far from transit, walkable neighborhoods, or tribal communities, making it harder for seniors, disabled people, low‑income workers, and Native communities to access in‑person assistance.\n\nThis is **a quiet form of structural violence**: the people least able to navigate digital bureaucracy or travel long distances are the first to lose convenient access to federal help.  \n\n#### 3. Environmental Degradation and Climate Backsliding\n\nThe Carter and Clinton frameworks were early federal attempts to align space policy with **sustainable urbanism**: concentrating offices in existing downtowns, using infrastructure efficiently, and reducing sprawl. ([wbdg.org](https://www.wbdg.org/fed/executive-orders/eo-12072?utm_source=openai))  \n\nBy contrast, EO 14274:\n\n- Removes incentives to co‑locate near transit or in walkable districts;  \n- Encourages dispersal into cheaper exurban office parks and greenfield sites; and  \n- Facilitates disposal of centrally located buildings in favor of new construction elsewhere.\n\nIn climate terms, this pushes the federal footprint toward **longer commutes, higher vehicle miles traveled, and higher per‑capita emissions**, directly cutting against smart‑growth and climate‑justice strategies that rely on dense, transit‑served employment centers.  \n\n#### 4. Democratic and Institutional Erosion\n\nFinally, there is the less visible but profound democratic harm:\n\n- **Physical distance from scrutiny.** Moving major functions out of central, media‑rich, advocacy‑dense cities makes it harder for journalists, unions, NGOs, and local officials to monitor agencies and organize workers.  \n\n- **Demoralization and attrition of the civil service.** Constant uncertainty about office closures, forced relocations, and lease terminations—based on opaque DOGE “savings” numbers—pushes experienced staff to retire or leave for the private sector, weakening institutional memory and the capacity to resist unlawful or unethical directives. ([businessinsider.com](https://www.businessinsider.com/doge-reduces-savings-claimed-from-ending-leases-150-million-2025-3?utm_source=openai))  \n\n- **Disempowerment of local governments.** With the revocation of 12072 and 13006, cities lose formal leverage in federal siting decisions, shifting power upward to GSA and the White House. This further entrenches a **top‑down, extractive model of governance** in which communities are acted upon, not engaged.  \n\nThe net effect is a more brittle, less accountable federal presence—one that serves as a pliant instrument of executive will rather than a distributed network of institutions embedded in and responsive to local democratic life.  \n\n---\n\n### Reversal Strategy\n\nTo undo the damage of EO 14274, a future administration should pursue a coordinated strategy of **immediate executive reversal, rigorous repair, and durable statutory reform.**\n\n1. **Issue a replacement EO on “Equitable Federal Facility Location and Historic Preservation.”**  \n   - On Day One, revoke EO 14274 and promulgate a new order that reinstates and modernizes the core principles of EO 12072 and EO 13006: first consideration for central business districts and historic properties, mandatory consultation with local and tribal governments, explicit integration of environmental justice and climate criteria, and transit‑accessibility requirements grounded in existing statutory authorities such as the National Historic Preservation Act and 40 U.S.C. § 3306. ([achp.gov](https://www.achp.gov/digital-library-section-106-landing/locating-federal-facilities-historic-properties-our-nations?utm_source=openai))  \n\n2. **Impose a moratorium and audit on space disposals and lease terminations driven by EO 14274/DOGE.**  \n   - Direct GSA and OMB to halt further lease cancellations, disposals, and major relocations initiated under the “common sense” framework pending a full audit of their fiscal claims and community impacts, with priority to restoring or relocating core public‑facing services—especially Social Security, BIA, health, and labor offices—to accessible, transit‑served urban and reservation locations. ([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/2b19594b17bb66cfc3122dd82c5663b8?utm_source=openai))  \n\n3. **Codify equitable siting principles in statute to prevent future executive sabotage.**  \n   - Work with Congress to amend 40 U.S.C. § 3306 and related provisions to embed requirements that federal facilities prioritize central cities, historic properties, transit access, and environmental‑justice communities, with enforceable consultation and impact‑analysis procedures and a clear role for the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation—ensuring that any future president cannot, with a single pen stroke, re‑weaponize federal space policy against cities, history, and vulnerable populations. ([law.cornell.edu](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/40/3306?utm_source=openai))  \n\nTaken together, these steps would not only roll back EO 14274 but also **rebuild a more resilient, equitable, and democratically grounded framework** for federal office space—one that treats public buildings not as disposable balance‑sheet entries, but as critical infrastructure for a multi‑racial democracy and a livable planet.\n\n\nPairwise evaluation payload placeholder."
