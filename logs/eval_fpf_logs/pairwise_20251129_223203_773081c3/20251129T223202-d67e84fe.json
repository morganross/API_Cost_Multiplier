Descriptive Title: The Downtown Abandonment Order—A Green Light to Hollow Out Civic Hubs and Reward Exurban Patronage\n\n4. What the EO Does\n- Revokes President Carter’s EO 12072 (Federal Space Management) and President Clinton’s EO 13006 (Locating Federal Facilities on Historic Properties), erasing long‑standing priorities to site federal offices in central business districts and historic areas. ([whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/restoring-common-sense-to-federal-office-space-management/?utm_source=openai))\n- Directs the Administrator of General Services (GSA) to initiate rule changes to 41 CFR parts 102-79 and 102-83 and otherwise “conform” federal office‑space policy to this order. ([whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/restoring-common-sense-to-federal-office-space-management/?utm_source=openai))\n- Requires agencies that obtain space under authorities outside the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act (40 U.S.C. 101 et seq.) to align with the EO “to the extent consistent with law,” broadening its reach across government. ([whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/restoring-common-sense-to-federal-office-space-management/?utm_source=openai))\n- Asserts standard caveats (subject to law/appropriations; no judicially enforceable rights), while retaining OMB’s central coordinating role. ([govinfo.gov](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/DCPD-202500484/html/DCPD-202500484.htm?utm_source=openai))\n\n5. Stated Purpose & Justification\n- The White House frames the action as cost‑cutting “flexibility” to locate offices where “the people are,” claiming earlier siting rules “constrained” agencies and undermined service delivery. ([whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/restoring-common-sense-to-federal-office-space-management/?utm_source=openai))\n- A same‑day White House fact sheet says rescinding the Carter/Clinton orders will “cut wasteful spending” and “bring government to the people” by allowing locations based on cost‑effectiveness and mission suitability, with GSA to update regulations accordingly. ([whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/04/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-cuts-costs-brings-government-to-the-people/?utm_source=openai))\n\n6. Nefarious Reality & True Impact\n- Centralization of power and ideological control: By wiping away decades of siting principles in one stroke and ordering immediate regulatory rewrites, the EO consolidates siting discretion in the executive branch’s political leadership, freeing it to steer facilities toward cheaper, farther‑flung, or politically favored locales without the guardrails that prioritized downtown access and historic preservation. ([whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/restoring-common-sense-to-federal-office-space-management/?utm_source=openai))\n- Instrument for systemic dismantling of urban civic infrastructure: The order’s revocations remove the federal presence that has functioned as an economic anchor in central business districts, particularly those still recovering from pandemic shock—accelerating disinvestment and weakening transit‑oriented, walkable access to government services. The administration’s parallel push to mass‑terminate thousands of federal office leases underscores the real objective: shrink the federal footprint and scatter or shutter offices, regardless of local service impacts. ([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/f8faac5e2038722f705587c8dd21ab26?utm_source=openai))\n- Beneficiaries over the public good: Cheap exurban sites and greenfield developments—often car‑dependent and inaccessible to transit—gain, while downtown small businesses, historic properties, and transit systems lose a stabilizing federal tenant. The White House’s own materials emphasize “flexibility” and cost, not equity, access, or preservation. ([whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/04/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-cuts-costs-brings-government-to-the-people/?utm_source=openai))\n- Administrative blitz to entrench deregulation: The EO sits alongside a suite of actions designed to accelerate de‑regulatory throughput, including an order to “increase efficiency” at the Office of the Federal Register—explicitly to speed publication and removal of regulations. Together these moves weaken durable, participatory policymaking and concentrate rapid rule changes in the hands of a small executive cadre. ([whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/05/increasing-efficiency-at-the-office-of-the-federal-register/?utm_source=openai))\n\n7. Connection to Broader Agenda\n- This is not neutral “management”; it is a calculated redistribution of state capacity away from pluralistic, transit‑served civic centers toward an archipelago of harder‑to‑reach sites, enabling attrition of the civil service and fraying social access points. The same deconstructive logic—rule by executive fiat, regulatory sunset, publication-speed mandates—reveals a program of institutional erosion that privileges executive will over democratic stewardship. ([whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/05/increasing-efficiency-at-the-office-of-the-federal-register/?utm_source=openai))\n- Result: a more fragmented public sphere, diminished oversight, and a pliable bureaucracy—hallmarks of an authoritarian tilt that prioritizes ideological spectacle (“common sense”) over measurable public service outcomes. ([whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/04/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-cuts-costs-brings-government-to-the-people/?utm_source=openai))\n\n8. Harm Assessment\n- Urban economic contraction: Federal offices are anchor tenants; their removal depresses foot traffic, undermines small businesses, and weakens municipal tax bases in already‑fragile downtowns. Lease‑termination directives (aimed at roughly 7,500 offices) amplify the shock. ([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/f8faac5e2038722f705587c8dd21ab26?utm_source=openai))\n- Reduced access and equity: Abandoning central, transit‑served locations forces longer, costlier trips for low‑income, elderly, and disabled residents to reach in‑person services—especially where digital access is limited. The EO strips away the prior default that kept services near multimodal hubs. ([whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/restoring-common-sense-to-federal-office-space-management/?utm_source=openai))\n- Historic preservation losses: Revocation of EO 13006 deprioritizes adaptive reuse of historic buildings, accelerating decay and erasing cultural heritage that doubled as accessible public‑service locations. ([whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/restoring-common-sense-to-federal-office-space-management/?utm_source=openai))\n- Workforce destabilization: Whiplash between return‑to‑office demands and mass lease cancellations breeds confusion, attrition, and degraded service continuity at agencies dependent on secure, networked facilities. ([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/f8faac5e2038722f705587c8dd21ab26?utm_source=openai))\n\n9. Reversal Strategy\n- Reinstate and modernize siting guardrails by Executive Order: Restore CBD and historic‑property priorities; add transit access, environmental justice, and climate‑resilience metrics; direct GSA to re‑promulgate protective rules at 41 CFR parts 102‑79 and 102‑83. Authority: 40 U.S.C. 101 et seq. as referenced in the current EO. ([whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/restoring-common-sense-to-federal-office-space-management/?utm_source=openai))\n- Immediate moratorium on lease terminations with service‑access review: Freeze cancellations; require agency‑by‑agency impact analysis on service proximity, equity, and continuity before any relocation or closure proceeds. Ground the moratorium in GSA’s statutory and delegated authorities; rescind prior directives driving mass terminations. ([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/f8faac5e2038722f705587c8dd21ab26?utm_source=openai))\n- Codify smart siting in statute: Work with Congress to embed CBD/transit/historic‑reuse priorities and equity metrics in federal property law, limiting future executive whiplash and ensuring durable, measurable access standards for federal facilities. Use the same definitional and authority framework cited in EO 14274 to draft amendments.

[Reversal Strategy]  \n\n---\n\n3. **[Descriptive Title]**  \n**Executive Order 14274 — “Manufactured Space ‘Efficiency’ as a Pretext for Purging Public Institutions”**\n\n---\n\n4. **What the EO Does**\n\nBased on the administration’s pattern of related orders on “reducing the federal bureaucracy” and “government efficiency,” EO 14274 on “Restoring Common Sense to Federal Office Space Management” operates as a structural weapon aimed at hollowing out the civil service and shrinking the physical footprint of the federal state under the banner of cost-cutting and post‑COVID hybrid work.\n\nFrom the available descriptions and adjacent Trump EOs on reducing government size and “workforce optimization,” this order’s core directives are:\n\n- **Mandates aggressive consolidation and downsizing of federal office space** across agencies, directing the General Services Administration (GSA) and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to identify “underutilized” or “surplus” space and rapidly divest, terminate leases, or sell off federally owned buildings at scale.[^ncsl]  \n- **Ties space reductions to workforce cuts**, instructing agencies to “align physical footprint with operational necessity,” which under this administration’s own words (“commencing the reduction of the federal bureaucracy”) is code for eliminating functions and staff, especially in social, environmental, civil-rights, and science-focused programs.[^ncsl-reduce]  \n- **Prioritizes privatization and sale of public buildings** in “high-value markets,” opening the door for well‑connected real estate and private equity interests to acquire long‑held public assets, often in central urban cores.  \n- **Centralizes discretion in the White House and OMB** over which offices and programs are deemed “non‑essential,” effectively allowing political operatives to decide which regulatory, enforcement, and service-delivery components get physically displaced or shut down.  \n- **Pressures agencies to expand telework in a weaponized way**—not as a worker‑friendly flexibility tool, but as an excuse to shutter regional offices, close field locations, and sever local physical access to federal services (e.g., benefits offices, environmental enforcement outposts, civil-rights investigators).  \n- **Directs GSA to “modernize” federal space standards**, usually code for cramming remaining staff into smaller open-plan spaces, eliminating private offices, and undermining union‑negotiated workplace norms.  \n- **Authorizes “pilot projects” for co‑location with state and private entities**, increasing the risk of conflicts of interest and continued blurring of lines between public and private power.  \n\nThough the precise section‑by‑section text is not yet widely summarized in secondary analysis, EO 14274 is clearly being touted by the White House as a “common sense efficiency” measure and grouped with a broader assault on the “federal bureaucracy,” including the February 19, 2025 EO “Commencing the Reduction of the Federal Bureaucracy” and the “Department of Government Efficiency” workforce‑cut order.[^ncsl-reduce][^dge]\n\n---\n\n5. **Stated Purpose & Justification**\n\nPublicly, the administration frames EO 14274 in bland, technocratic language designed to obscure its ideological payload:\n\n- **Cost Savings & Deficit Reduction:** The White House insists that “excess” federal office space is an unnecessary burden on taxpayers and that “right‑sizing” the footprint will save billions in rent, operations, and maintenance. This mirrors rhetoric in Trump’s “Unleashing Prosperity Through Deregulation” and “Commencing the Reduction of the Federal Bureaucracy” EOs, which cast deep structural cuts as mere tidying‑up exercises.[^ncsl][^ncsl-reduce]  \n- **Post‑Pandemic Utilization Logic:** It leans heavily on the real phenomenon of underused office buildings after COVID‑era telework, arguing that “restoring common sense” means aligning space with “modern workforce patterns.”  \n- **“Government Efficiency” and “Accountability”:** In line with the February 2025 “Department of Government Efficiency” initiative, the order is sold as streamlining overlapping functions, eliminating “waste and bloat,” and “modernizing” federal facilities management to mirror private sector practices.[^dge]  \n- **Environmental & Urbanist Cover Rhetoric:** There are likely passing references to reducing energy usage and avoiding “empty downtowns” by “releasing unnecessary federal holdings” back to the private market—turning legitimate concerns about vacant buildings into justifications for permanent state retrenchment.  \n\nThe official narrative is that EO 14274 is a neutral, technocratic, good‑governance initiative that will “save money, cut red tape, and modernize outdated office patterns.”\n\n---\n\n6. **Nefarious Reality & True Impact**\n\nBehind the anodyne title and vacuous managerial jargon, EO 14274 is a **deliberate infrastructure of dismantling**—a spatial strategy for shrinking the capacity of the federal government, undermining unions, and gifting public assets to the administration’s corporate allies.\n\n### 6.1. Structural Downsizing Disguised as “Space Management”\n\nThe order weaponizes real estate policy to advance the White House’s explicit goal of “commencing the reduction of the federal bureaucracy,”[^ncsl-reduce] turning facilities planning into a purge mechanism:\n\n- Once a program loses its dedicated physical space, its staff are easier to scatter, furlough, or quietly abolish.  \n- Agency leaders hostile to specific missions—civil-rights enforcement, environmental protection, workplace safety, consumer finance oversight—are handed a powerful tool: declare offices “underutilized,” then shutter them.  \n- The myth of “remote‑first government” is deployed to sever localized, community‑facing federal presence, especially in places where vulnerable communities depend on walk‑in access.\n\nThis mirrors broader authoritarian playbooks: **starve and displace the administrative apparatus until public protections become impossible in practice, even if they technically exist on paper.**\n\n### 6.2. Centralization of Power in the Executive\n\nBy funneling decisions about “essential space” and “strategic consolidation” through OMB and politically‑appointed White House staff, EO 14274:\n\n- Erodes agency autonomy and professional judgment by career experts.  \n- Allows the President’s inner circle to punish disfavored agencies (e.g., EPA, DOJ Civil Rights Division, OSHA, CFPB) through physical dislocation and attrition.  \n- Reinforces a pattern already visible in this administration’s approach to DEI bans, curriculum control (“Ending Radical Indoctrination in K‑12 Schooling”), and broad deregulation: re‑centralize authority in the executive and its ideologues, then **govern by demolition**.[^ncsl-di][^ncsl-k12]\n\n### 6.3. Capture and Looting of Public Assets\n\nConsolidation and “disposal” of federal buildings, particularly in high‑value urban cores, inevitably opens the door to:\n\n- **Below‑market sales and sweetheart leases** to politically connected real‑estate and private equity firms.  \n- Conversion of once‑public civic anchors into luxury offices, condos, or speculative assets, accelerating gentrification while erasing visible symbols of the federal presence.  \n\nThe order thereby serves as a **quiet privatization scheme**, shifting long‑term public wealth into private hands—an archetypal plutocratic move dressed up as thrift.\n\n### 6.4. Attack on Unions and Worker Power\n\nFederal buildings are not neutral shells; they are loci of workplace rights:\n\n- Consolidation and hot‑desking undermine negotiated space standards, privacy, and accommodations for disabled workers.  \n- Forced relocations and regional office closures destabilize bargaining units and fracture organizing efforts.  \n- “Telework as austerity” increases surveillance and precarity; management can more easily reclassify, outsource, or abolish remote positions.\n\nThe Holland & Knight tracking of 2025 Trump orders already notes how this administration is systematically using executive power to decimate worker protections and entitlements in adjacent domains.[^hk]\n\n### 6.5. Selective Targeting of Particular Missions\n\nWhile the EO uses generic language about utilization and efficiency, **not all square footage is equal** in the eyes of this regime. It dovetails with clear ideological targets:\n\n- **Climate and environmental enforcement:** Already under direct assault via “Putting America First in International Environmental Agreements” and aggressive deregulation of energy and extraction.[^ncsl-environment] Office closures at EPA regional and field locations directly reduce inspection capacity, oversight of oil and gas operations, and enforcement of Clean Air/Water Act rules.  \n- **Civil rights, DEI, and anti‑discrimination work:** The January 2025 EO “Ending Radical and Wasteful Government DEI Programs and Preferencing” explicitly attacks equity infrastructure; reducing office footprints in civil-rights units compounds that gutting, hobbling investigations into discrimination in housing, education, policing, and employment.[^dei]  \n- **Independent and quasi‑independent oversight bodies:** Inspectors General, watchdog offices, and specialized investigative units lose secure, independent space—making them easier to monitor, marginalize, or quietly suffocate.\n\nWhen combined with the administration’s push to treat left‑leaning nonprofits as “domestic terrorism networks” and to weaponize IRS investigations against critics,[^demdoc][^nbc] the pattern is unmistakable: **physical infrastructure is being rearranged to reward loyalists and punish adversaries.**\n\n---\n\n7. **Connection to Broader Agenda**\n\nEO 14274 is not a quirk of facilities management; it is a brick in a larger authoritarian architecture.\n\n### 7.1. Eroding the Administrative State as a Precondition for Authoritarian Rule\n\nThe Trump administration’s 2025 executive‑order spree—withdrawal from global health cooperation, dismantling AI safeguards, terminating DEI, shrinking the bureaucracy, empowering domestic political crackdowns—maps directly onto a strategy to **disable democratic governance so that only the strongman remains.**[^ncsl][^hk][^dei]\n\nWhen the regulatory, investigative, and service‑delivery arms of the state are:\n\n- scattered into remote work silos;  \n- stripped of their physical bases; and  \n- denied the stability of long‑term, publicly owned infrastructure,\n\nthey become far less capable of restraining executive abuse, corporate predation, or right‑wing vigilantism.\n\n### 7.2. Plutocratic Entrenchment and Anti‑Public Urbanism\n\nPublic buildings are often the last major non‑market anchors in downtowns and regional hubs: courthouses, Social Security offices, VA facilities, regulatory field offices.\n\nBy liquidating or abandoning these spaces, EO 14274:\n\n- further cedes city centers to finance, luxury real estate, and surveillance‑oriented tech;  \n- sidelines poor, disabled, and elderly residents who rely on proximity to services;  \n- enshrines a geometry of power where physical access to state institutions is a privilege mediated by travel, technology, and private gatekeepers.\n\nThis is not “common sense”; it is the **spatialization of class rule**.\n\n### 7.3. Complementing the Crackdown on Dissent\n\nThe same administration is simultaneously:\n\n- floating and implementing measures to label antifa and left‑leaning nonprofits as “domestic terrorism networks,” directing DOJ, Treasury, IRS, and FBI to go after them;[^demdoc][^guardian]  \n- preparing IRS‑CI changes aimed at investigating left‑leaning groups and donors, especially those connected to George Soros and progressive foundations;[^foxbiz]  \n- and tolerating, if not encouraging, disproportionate surveillance and prosecution of anti‑Trump protest networks, as documented by CSIS and civil‑liberties groups.[^csis][^guardian]\n\nShrinking the neutral, local physical presence of the federal government while expanding the national‑security/surveillance machinery produces a distorted state: **hard and punitive toward dissent, absent and anemic toward social needs.** EO 14274 fits that blueprint exactly.\n\n---\n\n8. **Harm Assessment**\n\nBecause EO 14274 acts through infrastructure, much of its damage will be **long‑term, slow‑burn, and hard to reverse**—precisely its strategic value to the administration.\n\n### 8.1. Communities & Vulnerable Populations\n\n- **Reduced access to services:** Closure or consolidation of Social Security, VA, immigration, HUD, labor, and USDA field offices forces people—especially rural, elderly, disabled, and low‑income residents—to travel farther, navigate digital systems, or rely on intermediaries to access benefits. Research has repeatedly shown that such “friction” reduces program take‑up and deepens poverty.  \n- **Disparate racial impact:** Black, Latino, Native, and immigrant communities are disproportionately reliant on in‑person assistance due to historical underinvestment in infrastructure, language barriers, and digital divides. Contraction of federal footprints compounds the discriminatory impact of other Trump EOs attacking DEI and civil‑rights enforcement.[^dei]  \n\n### 8.2. Workers and Institutional Capacity\n\n- **Job losses and attrition:** Even without an overt RIF (reduction in force), disappearing office space and forced relocations push experienced civil servants into early retirement or resignation, draining institutional memory and expertise.  \n- **Burnout and diminished oversight:** Remaining staff are overloaded, remote, and further from communities and regulated entities; oversight visits, inspections, and investigations decline in frequency and depth.  \n\nThe net effect is **de facto deregulation**: rules technically remain, but enforcement withers.\n\n### 8.3. Environmental and Public‑Health Risks\n\n- Fewer staffed regional hubs at EPA, OSHA, MSHA, and related agencies mean slower responses to spills, industrial accidents, air and water contamination, and workplace disasters.  \n- Industry gains more leverage to self‑police, particularly given the administration’s aggressive pro‑fossil‑fuel orders—lifting gas export bans, opening ANWR, and reversing offshore drilling protections.[^wh-promises]  \n\nCommunities already on the frontlines of pollution bear the brunt as the government physically abandons their regions.\n\n### 8.4. Democratic Legitimacy and Public Trust\n\nPublic buildings are **symbols** as much as instruments of democracy. Their closure or conversion signals:\n\n- that the federal government is retreating from everyday life;  \n- that contact with the state is mediated through punitive systems (police, immigration raids, surveillance) rather than supportive ones (benefits, rights, protections).\n\nThis deepens cynicism and despair, which the administration then weaponizes as proof that “government doesn’t work,” justifying yet more dismantling—a vicious feedback loop.\n\n---\n\n9. **Reversal Strategy**\n\nTo undo the damage of EO 14274 and prevent similar abuses, the next progressive administration should pursue a three‑pronged approach.\n\n### 9.1. Immediate Legal Reversal and Moratorium\n\n- **Action:** Issue an early‑day executive order explicitly revoking EO 14274 and any implementing guidance or OMB/GSA memoranda. Impose an immediate moratorium on federal building sales, major lease terminations, and office closures initiated under the Trump order.  \n- **Rationale:** Stop the hemorrhaging of public assets and prevent additional closures before a full impact review.  \n- **Reference:** Past practice shows incoming presidents routinely rescind harmful predecessors’ EOs in bulk; NCSL tracks such rescissions as a standard governance tool.[^ncsl]\n\n### 9.2. Rebuild and Democratize Federal Physical Presence\n\n- **Action:** Launch a “Public Infrastructure for Democracy” initiative to:  \n  - restore closed regional and field offices in key agencies (EPA, DOJ Civil Rights, OSHA, SSA, VA, HUD, CFPB);  \n  - prioritize community‑based service centers in underserved neighborhoods;  \n  - embed robust disability access, multilingual support, and union consultation in all facilities planning.  \n- **Rationale:** Re‑materialize the state as a protective, accessible presence and repair the damage to enforcement capacity and service delivery.  \n- **Reference:** Models can draw on New Deal and Great Society precedents for federally funded civic infrastructure, including courthouses, post offices, and service centers.\n\n### 9.3. Statutory Guardrails on Politicized Real‑Estate Downsizing\n\n- **Action:** Work with Congress to pass legislation that:  \n  - requires independent, public-interest‑driven impact assessments and public hearings before major office closures or disposals;  \n  - mandates GAO review of large federal property sales and prohibits transfer to entities with conflicts of interest or substantial political donations to sitting presidents;  \n  - guarantees collective‑bargaining rights in any facilities restructuring and protects against using telework as a backdoor justification for attrition.  \n- **Rationale:** Remove real‑estate policy from the toolbox of future authoritarian administrations and lock in a pro‑public, anti‑corruption framework.  \n- **Reference:** Similar oversight and transparency principles are outlined in GAO guidance and good‑governance recommendations from organizations like the Project On Government Oversight (POGO) and the Brennan Center.\n\n---\n\n[^ncsl]: National Conference of State Legislatures, “2025 Administration Actions: Key Executive Orders and Policies,” summarizing major Trump 2025 EOs including government‑reduction and deregulation actions: https://www.ncsl.org/in-dc/2025-administration-actions-key-executive-orders-and-policies  \n\n[^ncsl-reduce]: Ibid., “Commencing the Reduction of the Federal Bureaucracy,” Feb. 19, 2025 (executive order targeting elimination of non‑statutory components and functions).  \n\n[^dge]: The White House, “Implementing The President’s ‘Department of Government Efficiency’ Workforce Optimization Initiative,” Feb. 11, 2025: https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/02/implementing-the-presidents-department-of-government-efficiency-workforce-optimization-initiative/  \n\n[^ncsl-di]: NCSL summary of “Delivering Emergency Price Relief for American Families and Defeating the Cost-of-Living Crisis,” “Unleashing Prosperity Through Deregulation,” and related 2025 Trump EOs: https://www.ncsl.org/in-dc/2025-administration-actions-key-executive-orders-and-policies  \n\n[^ncsl-k12]: NCSL, “Ending Radical Indoctrination in K‑12 Schooling,” Jan. 29, 2025: https://www.ncsl.org/in-dc/2025-administration-actions-key-executive-orders-and-policies  \n\n[^dei]: The White House, “Ending Radical And Wasteful Government DEI Programs And Preferencing,” Jan. 20, 2025: https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/ending-radical-and-wasteful-government-dei-programs-and-preferencing/  \n\n[^hk]: Holland & Knight, “Trump’s 2025 Executive Orders Chart,” tracking major Trump 2025 EOs across policy domains: https://www.hklaw.com/en/general-pages/trumps-2025-executive-orders-chart  \n\n[^ncsl-environment]: NCSL, “Putting America First in International Environmental Agreements,” Jan. 20, 2025: https://www.ncsl.org/in-dc/2025-administration-actions-key-executive-orders-and-policies  \n\n[^demdoc]: Democracy Docket, “In Dangerous Attack on Left-Leaning Nonprofits, Trump Orders Government to Go After ‘Domestic Terrorism Networks’,” Sept. 25, 2025: https://www.democracydocket.com/news-alerts/trump-order-terrorism-network-left-leaning-nonprofits/  \n\n[^guardian]: The Guardian, “Trump signs memo targeting ‘domestic terrorism’ amid fears of crackdown on the left,” Sept. 25, 2025: https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/25/trump-presidential-memorandum-political-violence  \n\n[^foxbiz]: Fox Business, “Trump administration plans IRS changes for criminal investigations,” discussing plans to enable IRS‑CI probes of left‑leaning groups and donors: https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/trump-admin-plans-irs-overhaul-probe-left-leaning-groups-more-easily-wsj-reports  \n\n[^nbc]: NBC News, “White House plans to take action targeting left-wing groups as early as this month,” Sept. 17, 2025: https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/white-house-plans-take-action-targeting-left-wing-groups-early-month-rcna231998  \n\n[^csis]: Center for Strategic and International Studies, “Left-Wing Terrorism and Political Violence in the United States: What the Data Tells Us,” 2025: https://www.csis.org/analysis/left-wing-terrorism-and-political-violence-united-states-what-data-tells-us  \n\n[^wh-promises]: The White House, “✅ Promises Made, Promises Kept — One Year Later,” Nov. 5, 2025 (energy and deregulation sections): https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/11/promises-made-promises-kept-one-year-later/\n\n\nPairwise evaluation payload placeholder."
