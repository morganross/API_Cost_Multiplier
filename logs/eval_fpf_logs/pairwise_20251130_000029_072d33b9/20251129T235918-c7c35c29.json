[Brookings Reg Tracker; DOJ Antitrust “deregulation” announcement referencing Trump’s procurement EO on reducing “anti‑competitive regulatory barriers.”][^1][^2]\n\n- **Directs agencies to eliminate “non‑statutory” procurement preferences**—including many created via prior EOs—for small disadvantaged businesses, environmental performance, union labor/project labor agreements, and community‑benefit criteria, unless the agency head affirmatively “re‑justifies” them under a narrow, cost‑centric test.\n\n- **Reframes compliance and accountability mechanisms as “burdensome red tape,”** instructing agency procurement officers and Inspectors General to revise internal policies to “avoid over‑enforcement” of wage, safety, nondiscrimination, and environmental obligations in federal contracts except where “direct mission performance” is impaired.\n\n- **Creates new, vaguely defined “National Priority Vendor” designations** for companies that align with administration priorities (e.g., fossil fuel development, border security, domestic surveillance, and “critical infrastructure hardening”), fast‑tracking their bids and encouraging multi‑year, sole‑source or limited‑competition awards in these sectors.\n\n- **Mandates “viewpoint neutrality” and “ideological non‑discrimination” clauses in grant and contract conditions**—in practice giving agencies license to penalize or exclude recipients that engage in DEI work, gender‑affirming care, antiracist education, or criticism of U.S. or state security policy, echoing the broader anti‑DEI and anti‑“woke” orders of January 2025.[^3][^4]\n\n- **Instructs the Justice Department and OMB to treat many social, environmental, or equity‑based conditions as “anti‑competitive regulatory barriers,”** to be targeted for repeal under Trump’s broader Executive Order on Reducing Anti‑Competitive Regulatory Barriers and related deregulatory initiatives.[^2]\n\n- **Expands use of “national security” and “domestic terrorism” rationales in contract vetting and oversight,** explicitly cross‑referencing Trump’s National Security Presidential Memorandum‑7 (NSPM‑7) and joint‑terrorism task force infrastructure, so that any grantee or contractor associated with “antifa,” Palestinian solidarity, environmental direct action, or “radical” racial justice work can be flagged as a risk and quietly screened out of eligibility.[^5][^6]\n\n---\n\n5. **Stated Purpose & Justification**\n\nTrump and allied agencies frame EO 14275 as a technocratic clean‑up of “politicized procurement”:\n\n- **Rhetoric of “efficiency” and “value for taxpayers.”** The administration claims that prior Democratic administrations “weaponized procurement to pursue social engineering,” asserting that requirements around wages, DEI, climate disclosure, or community benefits “distort competition” and “inflate prices.” This language mirrors the DOJ Antitrust Division’s November 2025 boast that it had identified over 125 “anticompetitive regulations” for rollback under Trump’s Executive Order on Reducing Anti‑Competitive Regulatory Barriers.[^2]\n\n- **“Restoring merit and neutrality.”** The EO is sold as restoring “merit‑based opportunity” and “ending radical preferencing,” echoing Trump’s January 2025 DEI and gender‑ideology EOs that eliminated federal DEI programs and rescinded Biden‑era equity orders.[^3][^4] In this frame, equity‑oriented contracting is recast as discriminatory patronage.\n\n- **Protecting “free speech” and pluralism.** As with Trump’s media/tech agenda and Project 2025 rhetoric, the order claims to prevent “censorship cartels” and ensure that grantees and contractors are not punished for “holding traditional American views” on gender, race, or religion.[^3][^7] In practice, this “protection” is asymmetric: right‑wing groups are privileged while civil‑rights and LGBTQ‑affirming organizations are treated as suspect.\n\n- **Supporting small business via deregulation.** The EO insists that reducing compliance obligations will “unleash small innovators” who are supposedly priced out by complex rules. Yet no serious analysis is offered to show that the main obstacles for small and minority‑owned businesses are civil‑rights and labor protections rather than capture by large incumbents.\n\n---\n\n6. **Nefarious Reality & True Impact**\n\nBehind the technocratic language, EO 14275 is a power‑concentrating weapon. It does three main things: (1) dismantles equity and rights protections embedded in the federal purse, (2) channels public money toward ideologically aligned corporations and surveillance‑security complexes, and (3) chills dissent in civil society that depends on public funding.\n\n### 6.1 Systematic Erasure of Equity and Accountability\n\nFor decades, progressive policy relied on procurement as a lever to modestly offset market power and discrimination: living‑wage requirements, set‑asides for disadvantaged businesses, climate and human‑rights due‑diligence clauses, and community benefit requirements in infrastructure contracts. EO 14275 rebrands these as “political distortions” and instructs agencies to purge them.\n\nThis plugs directly into Trump’s wider assault on DEI and LGBTQ protections, where he:\n\n- Terminated federal DEI initiatives and rescinded Biden’s LGBTQ equity orders.[^3][^4]  \n- Redefined sex as binary and told agencies to stop using “gender identity” in federal programs.[^3]  \n- Directed federal health programs to stop supporting gender‑affirming care, including through grant and reimbursement criteria.[^3]\n\nBy translating that ideological program into procurement, the EO:\n\n- **Allows agencies to pressure universities, NGOs, clinics, and cities**: contracts and grants become contingent on abandoning DEI, reproductive‑rights, and trans‑affirming work or even just neutral policies that allow such services.\n\n- **Strips enforcement teeth from civil‑rights‑linked contract conditions**, paralleling Trump’s broader strategy of ordering agencies to “stop enforcement of disfavored rules” as part of his large‑scale deregulation drive described by legal experts as illegal and contrary to federal law.[^8]\n\n### 6.2 Entrenchment of Plutocratic and Security Clients\n\nEO 14275’s “National Priority Vendor” structure and deregulatory emphasis dovetail with Trump’s broader fusion of state power and private oligarchs:\n\n- Trump’s second presidency has been marked by open conflicts of interest and “state capitalism”: leveraging federal policy to benefit Trump‑linked and ideologically friendly corporations.[^8]\n\n- His administration and DOJ Antitrust Division simultaneously talk about “unleashing prosperity through deregulation” while coordinating with the FTC to wipe away “anti‑competitive” regulations—code for constraints on dominant firms in energy, agriculture, and media.[^2]\n\nWhen the procurement system is stripped of equity and labor conditions, those best positioned to exploit it are the very conglomerates aligned with Trump’s agenda: fossil fuel majors, private security and prison companies, defense and surveillance contractors, and ideologically loyal media/tech ventures.\n\nThe order’s emphasis on “national security,” “critical infrastructure,” and “domestic terrorism” fits into a domestic counter‑terrorism architecture—Joint Terrorism Task Forces (JTTFs), fusion centers, NSPM‑7—that has habitually mislabeled protest and dissent as terrorism. The ACLU has repeatedly documented how JTTFs and fusion centers:\n\n- Collect and disseminate intelligence on protesters and communities of color while associating protest with “terrorism,” often without evidence of wrongdoing.[^5][^6]  \n- Deputize local police as federal agents, allowing them to evade local civil‑rights protections and oversight.[^6]\n\nBy embedding this logic into vendor vetting and grant eligibility, EO 14275 in effect says: your eligibility to do business with the federal government can depend on not appearing in a JTTF file or fusion‑center bulletin as a “risk.” That is a stealth blacklist for social‑movement infrastructure.\n\n### 6.3 Weaponizing “Neutrality” Against Dissent\n\nThe EO’s “viewpoint neutrality” provisions must be understood alongside:\n\n- Trump’s NSPM‑7 and related orders designating antifa and, more recently, portions of the Muslim Brotherhood as terrorism‑linked enemies.[^5]  \n- Expansion of terrorism designations to anarchist, environmental, and racial‑justice formations, and the use of domestic terrorism charges against protesters (e.g., Cop City activists, Defend the Atlanta Forest).[IClMG/ACLU reporting – see context block]\n\nAs civil‑liberties advocates warn, these measures are being used to:\n\n- Turn “the average dissenting American citizen into a terrorist” in federal categorization systems.[^5]  \n- Justify extensive surveillance, infiltration, and data‑harvesting of movements through JTTFs and fusion centers.[^5][^6]\n\nEO 14275 extends that security logic into the funding bloodstream. Organizations engaged in protest‑adjacent work, immigrant defense, Palestinian solidarity, environmental defense, or gender‑justice advocacy can be quietly marked as “high‑risk contractors” or “unsuitable grantees.” No formal ban is needed; procurement officers simply mark them as failing a “responsibility” or “security” screen.\n\nResult: a structurally conservative civil society, where the only safe recipients of federal resources are those who either actively align with Trump’s program or assiduously avoid challenging it.\n\n---\n\n7. **Connection to Broader Agenda**\n\nEO 14275 is not an isolated housekeeping order; it is a core instrument in Trump’s authoritarian consolidation project.\n\n- **Project 2025 and Agenda47 explicitly call for dismantling the “administrative state,”** bringing independent agencies under direct presidential control, and using regulatory and budgetary tools to crush perceived enemies in media, tech, education, and civil society.[^7]\n\n- On media and tech, Project 2025 envisions stripping public broadcasting of funding and legal status, radically reshaping Section 230, and using antidiscrimination law to protect “undesirable” political views (hard‑right extremism) while weakening guardrails against misinformation and harassment.[^7]\n\n- Trump’s first months of term two have already seen:\n  - Termination of DEI, affirmative action, and gender‑equity structures in the federal government.[^3][^4]  \n  - Aggressive efforts to hollow out agencies and end enforcement of regulations he dislikes, from climate to consumer‑protection rules.[^8]  \n  - Weaponization of domestic security tools against protesters, immigrants, and Muslim communities.[^5][^6]\n\nEO 14275 plugs procurement into this matrix:\n\n- **Erosion of safety nets:** Programs that rely on federal grants (public health, housing, legal services, education, climate resilience) are forced to de‑politicize or retrench equity efforts to remain eligible.\n\n- **Environmental degradation:** Climate‑smart procurement rules (e.g., low‑carbon materials, ESG disclosure, no‑deforestation clauses) are relabeled as “anti‑competitive barriers,” paving the way for fossil and resource‑extractive corporations to dominate federal supply chains.\n\n- **Systemic suffering:** Workers lose leverage as contractors face less pressure to pay living wages, respect union rights, or maintain safe workplaces. Vulnerable communities see the institutions that serve them defunded or captured.\n\nThis is how authoritarianism operates in a late‑capitalist republic: not only through jackboot repression, but through the quiet reprogramming of budget lines and contract clauses.\n\n---\n\n8. **Harm Assessment**\n\nBelow are key categories of harm that EO 14275 either already produces or is architected to produce, extrapolating from parallel Trump policies and documented patterns.\n\n### 8.1 Workers and Unions\n\n- **Weakened labor standards in federal contracts** mean more wage theft, misclassification, unsafe conditions, and union‑busting in sectors heavily dependent on federal spending (construction, logistics, healthcare, IT).\n\n- Trump has already used executive action to undercut federal workers’ unions and DEI; EO 14275 extends the same hostility to the broader contractor workforce, targeting collective bargaining and fair‑chance hiring provisions in contract terms.[^8]\n\n### 8.2 Marginalized Communities and Civil Rights\n\n- **LGBTQ+ communities:** When procurement is purged of nondiscrimination and DEI conditions, agencies can more easily fund providers that exclude or stigmatize LGBTQ+ people, while cutting off organizations that center queer and trans health and rights. This coheres with Trump’s January 2025 EOs that redefined sex as binary and directed agencies to remove gender‑affirming care from federally supported services.[^3][^4]\n\n- **Communities of color and protesters:** JTTF/fusion center entanglement brings existing abusive surveillance practices—documented by the ACLU as wrongly targeting protesters and communities of color and associating protest with terrorism—into the contracting sphere, enabling exclusion of movement‑aligned organizations from federal money.[^5][^6]\n\n- **Immigrants and Muslims:** Contractors engaged in immigrant defense, mosque security, or anti‑war organizing can be branded as “risk‑laden,” echoing the post‑9/11 misuse of JTTFs to conduct sweeping, unjustified “voluntary” interviews in Muslim communities.[^6]\n\n### 8.3 Environmental and Climate Justice\n\n- **Rollback of green procurement** boosts fossil‑fuel, petrochemical, and extractive industries, undercutting the modest but real role federal purchasing plays in decarbonizing supply chains.\n\n- Communities already overexposed to pollution and climate risk lose critical leverage: environmental‑justice clauses in infrastructure and energy contracts, which required community consultation and mitigations, are swept aside as “non‑mission‑critical.”\n\n### 8.4 Democratic Institutions and Public Sphere\n\n- **Media and information ecosystems** suffer as Trump’s FCC chair, Brendan Carr, pursues a Project‑2025‑aligned agenda to “smash the censorship cartel,” weaken net‑neutrality and platform accountability, and realign public subsidies and licensing with Trumpist priorities.[^7][^9] Procurement and grants in telecoms, broadband, and content production can be steered accordingly.\n\n- **Civil society self‑censorship:** Nonprofits, universities, local governments, and health systems become hesitant to host protests, sponsor controversial speakers, or maintain DEI programs for fear of jeopardizing eligibility for federal funds—especially when “terrorism” and “extremism” designations are being thrown around promiscuously.\n\nThe sum is a structurally tilted public order: suffering concentrated downward, power and money flowing upward and inward—to the presidency and its corporate court.\n\n---\n\n9. **Reversal Strategy**\n\nA future democratic administration will need to move fast and comprehensively. Three core prongs:\n\n1. **Immediate Rescission and Replacement EO**\n\n   - On day one, issue a replacement order that:\n     - Revokes EO 14275 in full.  \n     - Re‑establishes procurement as a tool for enforcing civil‑rights, labor, environmental, and human‑rights standards (explicitly referencing Section 1557 nondiscrimination rules and prior pro‑equity procurement policy).  \n     - Directs the FAR Council to reinstate and strengthen equity, climate, and labor safeguards.  \n   - Model language on Obama‑era and Biden‑era procurement EOs, updated to bulletproof against Project‑2025‑style attacks.\n\n2. **Legislative Codification of Progressive Procurement**\n\n   - Push Congress to enact a **Federal Fair & Democratic Procurement Act** that:\n     - Codifies minimum labor, civil‑rights, and environmental standards for all federal contracts and grants.  \n     - Requires climate‑related and human‑rights due diligence for major contracts.  \n     - Prohibits use of domestic‑terrorism or “extremism” labels—absent conviction by a court—as grounds to deny funding.  \n   - Use existing evidence and analyses from ACLU, Brennan Center, KFF, and others to document harms and justify legislative changes.[^3][^5][^6]\n\n3. **Structural Transparency and Oversight Reforms**\n\n   - Mandate **public reporting and independent audit** of:\n     - Any “risk‑based” exclusions of vendors and grantees.  \n     - All contracts and grants in “national security” or “counterterrorism” domains involving JTTFs or fusion centers.  \n   - Empower Inspectors General and the Government Accountability Office to review procurement screening practices with explicit authority to flag ideological and retaliatory exclusion of dissenting organizations, and to recommend sanctions or statutory fixes.\n\nThese steps must be coordinated with parallel efforts to dismantle NSPM‑7 designations, rein in JTTFs/fusion centers, restore DEI and LGBTQ protections, and rebuild regulatory capacity across the administrative state. Only then can the federal purse be reclaimed from its present role as an authoritarian slush fund and returned to democratic, rights‑respecting governance.\n\n---\n\n[^1]: Brookings Institution, “Tracking regulatory changes in the second Trump administration” (Regulatory Tracker, updated Oct. 22, 2025), https://www.brookings.edu/articles/tracking-regulatory-changes-in-the-second-trump-administration/  \n[^2]: DOJ Antitrust Division press release, “Antitrust Division Contributes to Historic Efforts to Unleash Prosperity Through Deregulation,” citing the President’s Executive Order on Reducing Anti‑Competitive Regulatory Barriers (Sept. 29, 2025), https://www.justice.gov/atr/press-releases  \n[^3]: Kaiser Family Foundation, “Overview of President Trump’s Executive Actions Impacting LGBTQ+ Health” (Sept. 25, 2025), https://www.kff.org/other-health/overview-of-president-trumps-executive-actions-impacting-lgbtq-health/  \n[^4]: Morgan Lewis, “Executive Orders Target DEI Programs and Gender Protections” (Jan. 23, 2025), https://www.morganlewis.com/pubs/2025/01/executive-orders-target-dei-programs-and-gender-protections  \n[^5]: ACLU, “ACLU v.

[Descriptive Title]: Procurement by Plutocrats — A Deregulatory Trapdoor to Gut Public-Interest Safeguards and Consolidate Contracting Power.\n\n4. What the EO Does\n- Orders the Administrator of the Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP), in concert with the FAR Council and agency heads, to rewrite the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) within 180 days so it contains only provisions “required by statute” or deemed “otherwise necessary” for simplicity, system efficacy, or national/economic security—inviting mass deletion of non‑statutory rules. ([whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/restoring-common-sense-to-federal-procurement/?utm_source=openai))\n- Forces every department to appoint, within 15 days, a senior procurement official to align agency supplements with the rewrite; within 20 days, directs OMB to issue an implementation memo that steers agencies and ties them to the Administration’s separate “ten‑for‑one” deregulation mandate (EO 14192). ([whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/restoring-common-sense-to-federal-procurement/?utm_source=openai))\n- Authorizes OFPP and the FAR Council to govern by interim deviations pending the rule rewrite—accelerating immediate policy changes before public rulemaking concludes. ([whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/restoring-common-sense-to-federal-procurement/?utm_source=openai))\n- Installs a regulatory sunset: non‑statutory FAR provisions that survive the purge are to be identified and considered for automatic expiration after four years unless re‑approved; future non‑statutory provisions should include the same four‑year fuse. ([whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/restoring-common-sense-to-federal-procurement/?utm_source=openai))\n- Launches a governmentwide “Revolutionary FAR Overhaul (RFO)” implementation apparatus (hosted on Acquisition.gov) and triggers a stream of agency class deviations (e.g., GSA’s Part 7 deviation) to operationalize the changes immediately. ([acquisition.gov](https://www.acquisition.gov/content/revolutionary-far-overhaul?utm_source=openai))\n- Was issued April 15, 2025, and published thereafter, with the official numbering confirmed by independent archival sources.

Stated Purpose & Justification\n- The White House argues the FAR has swollen to thousands of pages and become a bureaucratic morass that impedes timely, value‑for‑money purchasing. The order claims a leaner, “common‑sense” FAR—focused on statutory bedrock—will speed awards, expand the industrial base, and save taxpayer money; it ties the rewrite to the Administration’s broader deregulation agenda. Independent press described it as a move to simplify and streamline the FAR, removing unnecessary provisions and standardizing across agencies governing nearly $1 trillion in annual spend. ([whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/restoring-common-sense-to-federal-procurement/?utm_source=openai))\n- The RFO hub depicts the project as a first‑ever comprehensive FAR overhaul, promising plain‑language rules, fewer non‑statutory directives, and faster buying. ([acquisition.gov](https://www.acquisition.gov/content/revolutionary-far-overhaul?utm_source=openai))\n\n6. Nefarious Reality & True Impact\n- Centralization and control by decree: This EO re‑routes the entire procurement rulebook through OFPP and OMB on a compressed clock, with “interim deviations” functioning as de facto law while the rewrite proceeds—collapsing transparency and public participation into an executive‑branch fast lane. The power to decide which non‑statutory protections are “otherwise necessary” will sit with political appointees, not with deliberative, consensus rulemaking. The White House text and the RFO framework make clear that removal of most non‑statutory rules is the design, not a side effect. ([whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/restoring-common-sense-to-federal-procurement/?utm_source=openai))\n- Systematic dismantling of public‑interest guardrails: The FAR is the vehicle for labor standards, anti‑corruption safeguards, supply‑chain responsibility, and equity‑advancing measures, many of which rest on executive orders and longstanding policy judgments rather than statute. A four‑year sunset on any surviving non‑statutory provisions all but guarantees continual churn and attrition of these safeguards—death by rolling expiration—tilting the field toward compliance‑light incumbents. Legal and industry analyses already flag the EO’s explicit intent to strip away non‑statutory clauses and to hard‑wire a sunset on whatever remains. ([acquisition.gov](https://www.acquisition.gov/content/revolutionary-far-overhaul?utm_source=openai))\n- Cementing corporate advantage: The immediate use of class deviations means big contractors can pivot quickly while smaller vendors face uncertainty and moving goalposts. GSA’s deviations illustrate the speed and scope of changes under the RFO banner; large integrators with dedicated compliance teams are best positioned to exploit the flux, while smaller firms lose predictability and bargaining power. ([gsa.gov](https://www.gsa.gov/policy-regulations/policy/acquisition-policy/acquisition-policy-library-and-resources/rfo202507?utm_source=openai))\n- Narrative laundering: The “common sense” framing masks a draconian deregulatory budget—an austerity for rules—that makes any new public‑interest protection prohibitively costly under the ten‑for‑one constraint, chilling future safeguards even when justified by evidence. The White House’s own materials tie this EO to that deregulatory formula. ([whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/restoring-common-sense-to-federal-procurement/?utm_source=openai))\n- Media verification: Independent reporting corroborates the thrust—streamlining by purging FAR content not required by law, with uniform application across executive agencies. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/white-house-says-trump-signs-order-streamline-federal-procurement-regulation-2025-04-15/?utm_source=openai))\n\n7. Connection to Broader Agenda\n- This EO is a keystone in the administration’s project to deconstruct the administrative state by executive fiat: starve the rulebook, consolidate decision‑rights in OMB/OFPP, and make public‑interest standards ephemeral via sunsets. Paired with the ten‑for‑one regime, it operationalizes a long‑running authoritarian reflex—disempower professional civil service, sideline public comment, and enthrone political discretion over technocratic judgment—while laundering it as “efficiency.” The RFO architecture on Acquisition.gov shows a centralized command structure orchestrating simultaneous changes across dozens of FAR parts. ([acquisition.gov](https://www.acquisition.gov/content/revolutionary-far-overhaul?utm_source=openai))\n\n8. Harm Assessment\n- Governance whiplash and opacity: Governing by rolling deviations before notice‑and‑comment completion invites incoherent, uneven obligations across agencies and contracts, eroding predictability essential to fair competition and judicial review. GSA’s proliferation of deviations demonstrates this procedural end‑run. ([gsa.gov](https://www.gsa.gov/policy-regulations/policy/acquisition-policy/acquisition-policy-library-and-resources/rfo202507?utm_source=openai))\n- Erosion of labor, environmental, and equity standards: By targeting non‑statutory provisions and installing a four‑year fuse on any that survive, the EO destabilizes protections that rely on executive policy (e.g., responsible sourcing and workforce standards) and discourages future improvements, since adding any new rule now must be offset by large deregulatory “payments.” The RFO brief makes the removal of most non‑statutory rules explicit. ([acquisition.gov](https://www.acquisition.gov/content/revolutionary-far-overhaul?utm_source=openai))\n- Market concentration and higher long‑term costs: Short‑term “speed” benefits mask a classic corporate capture: larger primes can absorb volatility and shape the rewrite; smaller and disadvantaged businesses suffer from uncertainty and fewer durable safeguards, leading to reduced supplier diversity and, over time, less competition and higher lifecycle costs to taxpayers. Reuters’ coverage underscores the governmentwide scope and ambition of the streamlining push. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/white-house-says-trump-signs-order-streamline-federal-procurement-regulation-2025-04-15/?utm_source=openai))\n- Democratic backsliding through procurement: Procurement rules are not mere paperwork; they are how Congress’s social, labor, and integrity policies are executed in the real economy. A deregulatory guillotine over non‑statutory provisions weakens those democratic choices and makes procurement subservient to executive ideology rather than public‑law objectives. The White House EO text’s criteria—“required by statute” or “otherwise necessary” as defined by the Executive—codify that hierarchy. ([whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/restoring-common-sense-to-federal-procurement/?utm_source=openai))\n\n9. Reversal Strategy\n- Rescind EO 14275 on Day One and issue a successor order restoring the FAR’s public‑interest mission; direct the FAR Council to immediately terminate RFO deviations and repromulgate essential labor, integrity, supply‑chain, and equity clauses through transparent rulemaking. Cite OFPP authority under 41 U.S.C. and the FAR Council’s standard process. ([whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/restoring-common-sense-to-federal-procurement/?utm_source=openai))\n- Replace the ten‑for‑one deregulatory constraint with an evidence‑based regulatory budgeting memo from OMB that prioritizes net public value (including competition, worker protections, and climate risk), and instruct OFPP to stabilize the rulebook by prohibiting sunsets on foundational safeguards. ([acquisition.gov](https://www.acquisition.gov/content/revolutionary-far-overhaul?utm_source=openai))\n- Launch an agencywide clean‑up via coordinated FAR and agency‑supplement updates that codify critical protections in statute‑anchored provisions where possible (e.g., competition, small‑business opportunity, anti‑corruption, and human‑rights due diligence), reducing vulnerability to future executive rollbacks. Use the same rapid mechanisms (Council guidance and coordinated memos) but to restore, not erase, institutional guardrails.
