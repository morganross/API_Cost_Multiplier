It casts the existing 2,000‑plus‑page FAR as an “excessive and overcomplicated” bureaucracy and uses that diagnosis to justify a sweeping purge. ([presidency.ucsb.edu](https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/executive-order-14275-restoring-common-sense-federal-procurement?utm_source=openai))  \n\n- **Orders an accelerated 180‑day purge and rewrite of the FAR.**  \n  It directs the Administrator of the Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP), working with the FAR Council and agency heads, to overhaul the FAR within 180 days so that only statutorily required or narrowly defined “necessary” provisions remain. That clock is deliberately compressed, forcing agencies into a rushed, centrally orchestrated rewrite rather than deliberative reform. ([presidency.ucsb.edu](https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/executive-order-14275-restoring-common-sense-federal-procurement?utm_source=openai))  \n\n- **Imposes a recurring regulatory sunset on non‑statutory protections.**  \n  EO 14275 instructs the FAR Council to (a) identify the non‑statutory FAR provisions that will be allowed to survive and (b) consider amending the FAR so that every such provision automatically expires four years after the new rules take effect unless it is explicitly renewed. Any new non‑statutory provision going forward is expected to carry the same four‑year fuse. ([presidency.ucsb.edu](https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/executive-order-14275-restoring-common-sense-federal-procurement?utm_source=openai))  \n\n- **Extends “regulatory budgeting” and the ten‑for‑one constraint into procurement.**  \n  The order operationalizes Trump’s earlier EO 14192 (“Unleashing Prosperity Through Deregulation”) inside procurement: it directs the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to issue an implementation memo that both promotes “expedited and streamlined acquisitions” and ties new agency‑level requirements to the ten‑for‑one mandate—ten existing requirements must be eliminated for each new one adopted. ([presidency.ucsb.edu](https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/executive-order-14275-restoring-common-sense-federal-procurement?utm_source=openai))  \n\n- **Embeds deregulatory liaisons throughout the executive branch.**  \n  Within 15 days, every department and agency that uses the FAR must designate a senior acquisition official to coordinate with OFPP and the FAR Council, identify “inconsistent” agency‑specific rules, and align all agency supplements with the EO’s minimalist policy. This creates a government‑wide enforcement network for deregulation. ([presidency.ucsb.edu](https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/executive-order-14275-restoring-common-sense-federal-procurement?utm_source=openai))  \n\n- **Authorizes governance by class deviations and interim guidance.**  \n  EO 14275 explicitly empowers OFPP and the FAR Council to implement its changes through “deviations” and interim guidance while the formal rewrite is pending. In practice, agencies such as GSA have issued broad class deviations instructing the acquisition workforce to ignore codified FAR text (for example, existing FAR part 25) and instead follow RFO model language posted on Acquisition.gov, making these deviations de facto law before any notice‑and‑comment process concludes. ([gsa.gov](https://www.gsa.gov/policy-regulations/policy/acquisition-policy/acquisition-policy-library-and-resources/rfo202525?utm_source=openai))  \n\n- **Launches the “Revolutionary FAR Overhaul” (RFO) apparatus.**  \n  The EO has spawned a centralized “Revolutionary FAR Overhaul” program: a dedicated portal on Acquisition.gov hosts model deviation texts for multiple FAR parts; agencies including HHS, DHS, and GSA issue matching class deviations to substitute these models for existing rules; and agency‑level regulations (e.g., HHSAR) are being rewritten to track the stripped‑down framework in lockstep with the RFO templates. ([hhs.gov](https://www.hhs.gov/grants-contracts/contracts/contract-policies-regulations/hhsar-class-deviation-2025-03/index.html?utm_source=openai))  \n\n- **Establishes EO 14275 as the legal engine behind a government‑wide rewrite.**  \n  The American Presidency Project records the order as signed on April 15, 2025 and published in the Federal Register on April 18, 2025, confirming its status as the operative legal authority for this “most comprehensive reform of the FAR” in four decades. ([presidency.ucsb.edu](https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/executive-order-14275-restoring-common-sense-federal-procurement?utm_source=openai))  \n\n---\n\n5. **Stated Purpose & Justification**  \n\nIn its own words and in official explanatory materials, the administration frames EO 14275 as a technocratic clean‑up of a bloated system:\n\n- **Problem framing: a swollen, inefficient rulebook.**  \n  The EO asserts that the FAR has “swelled” into an overlong, excessively complex code that impedes efficient purchasing, burdens contractors, and undermines the Federal Acquisition System’s official “vision” of delivering best value while maintaining public trust and fulfilling public‑policy objectives. It cites a 2024 Senate report (“Restoring Freedom’s Forge”) and the 2019 Advisory Panel on Streamlining and Codifying Acquisition Regulations as evidence that procurement rules have become a barrier to effective management of nearly $1 trillion in annual spending. ([presidency.ucsb.edu](https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/executive-order-14275-restoring-common-sense-federal-procurement?utm_source=openai))  \n\n- **Promised benefits: agility, lower costs, expanded industrial base.**  \n  EO 14275 claims that by pruning “unnecessary” and non‑statutory provisions, the government will create “the most agile, effective, and efficient procurement system possible.” The administration argues that simpler, clearer regulations will speed awards, reduce administrative costs, encourage more firms (especially commercial vendors) to do business with the government, and thereby strengthen both the national and defense industrial base. ([presidency.ucsb.edu](https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/executive-order-14275-restoring-common-sense-federal-procurement?utm_source=openai))  \n\n- **Regulatory minimalism presented as common sense.**  \n  RFO‑branded materials from agencies describe the initiative as a modernization and plain‑language project that will eliminate duplicative or outdated text, remove language “not required by statute,” clarify remaining requirements, and “preserve essential governmentwide acquisition standards”—assuring stakeholders that only true clutter is being cut. ([dhs.gov](https://www.dhs.gov/cpo-dhs-far-overhaul-deviations?utm_source=openai))  \n\n- **A “revolutionary” but supposedly neutral overhaul.**  \n  Legal and industry commentary underscores the administration’s characterization of EO 14275 as the most sweeping FAR rewrite since its creation over 40 years ago, intended to transform an allegedly overbearing regime into a lean set of “essential” regulations while continuing to support core procurement goals. ([wiley.law](https://www.wiley.law/decoding-the-far-rewrite?utm_source=openai))  \n\nTaken at face value, the EO presents itself as a neutral exercise in simplification: removing red tape, modernizing archaic language, and accelerating government buying in the name of taxpayers and national security.  \n\n---\n\n6. **Nefarious Reality & True Impact**  \n\nBehind the soothing rhetoric of “common sense” and “plain language,” EO 14275 is a structural attack on democratic control over nearly a trillion dollars in public spending. It dismantles enforceable public‑interest safeguards, replaces them with soft law and discretionary power, and consolidates procurement control in the hands of a small cadre of political appointees.\n\n#### a. Bypassing the Administrative Procedure Act through “deviate‑first” governance  \n\nThe EO’s most dangerous feature is procedural. Rather than beginning with transparent, APA‑compliant rulemaking, it licenses an inverted sequence:\n\n1. **Immediate substitution of model text via deviations.**  \n   RFO model clauses and redlines are posted on Acquisition.gov; agencies are told—explicitly, in GSA’s Part 25 deviation—to follow the model language “instead of” the codified FAR part for all procurements. ([gsa.gov](https://www.gsa.gov/policy-regulations/policy/acquisition-policy/acquisition-policy-library-and-resources/rfo202525?utm_source=openai))  \n\n2. **Only later, if ever, is formal rulemaking undertaken.**  \n   Once deviations are entrenched as the operational baseline, the FAR Council may eventually promulgate formal rules. By that point, the new regime is already normalized across live contracts, and public comment is a post‑hoc formality rather than a meaningful opportunity to shape outcomes.\n\nThis “deviate now, rulemake later” method effectively sidelines the Administrative Procedure Act’s requirement that major policy changes be subject to prior notice, public participation, and reasoned explanation. Instead, entire FAR parts are being rewritten in the shadows of class deviations, then laundered into formal regulations after the fact.\n\n#### b. Hollowing out enforceable rules and replacing them with soft law  \n\nEO 14275’s minimalist mandate is not value‑neutral. Non‑statutory provisions in the FAR are precisely where decades of public‑interest policy have been embedded: small‑business access, labor protections, environmental standards, anti‑corruption measures, and equity‑advancing requirements.\n\nThe RFO architecture works to:\n\n- **Strip these protections from the binding FAR text**, under the banner of removing language “not required by statute,” and  \n- **Relocate detail into non‑binding guidance**—FAR “companions,” strategic acquisition guidance, buying guides, and agency manuals that typically disclaim legal force. ([wiley.law](https://www.wiley.law/decoding-the-far-rewrite?utm_source=openai))  \n\nWhen a requirement lives in the FAR, contractors and affected communities can invoke it in bid protests, contract disputes, and litigation; agencies can be forced to comply. When the same principle is relegated to a “guide” that is advisory only, it becomes optional. What was once a right or obligation becomes a suggestion—subject to waiver, political pressure, or quiet neglect.\n\nThis migration from hard law to soft guidance is a classic authoritarian maneuver: it keeps just enough rhetoric about “values” and “policy goals” on paper to placate audiences, while severing those goals from any durable enforcement mechanism.\n\n#### c. Systematic undermining of small‑business, labor, equity, and environmental protections  \n\nAlthough official RFO materials insist they are merely simplifying and clarifying, the deregulatory design is transparent in several domains:\n\n- **Small‑business and supplier diversity.**  \n  RFO deviations for small‑business rules (e.g., FAR part 19) loudly proclaim that they “emphasize the importance of small businesses” while promising more intuitive, streamlined regulations. ([gsa.gov](https://www.gsa.gov/policy-regulations/policy/acquisition-policy/acquisition-policy-library-and-resources/rfo202519?utm_source=openai))  But the broader RFO instruction—to eliminate non‑statutory language and collapse detail into guidance—inevitably weakens the practical mechanisms that make supplier diversity real: mandated market research, set‑aside triggers, and specific evaluation criteria that favor small and disadvantaged firms. What remains is aspirational text about opportunity, detached from concrete procedural obligations.\n\n- **Labor standards and workplace protections.**  \n  Many existing FAR clauses that operationalize labor‑rights commitments—nondiscrimination provisions, reporting requirements, and contract‑based enforcement of wage and safety policies—rest on executive policy rather than explicit statutory commands. Under EO 14275’s hierarchy, such clauses are presumptively expendable or candidates for relegation to non‑binding guidance. That opens the door for agencies and contractors to treat worker protections as optional frills rather than enforceable conditions of doing business with the government.\n\n- **Environmental and climate safeguards.**  \n  Similar logic applies to sustainability and climate‑related requirements. Where Congress has not spelled out detailed procurement obligations in statute, those obligations survive only as long as they are encoded in binding FAR text. EO 14275 pressures the system to strip those rules out, convert them into “best practices,” and subject any new climate‑oriented clauses to the ten‑for‑one deregulatory tax—making future progress politically and administratively costly.\n\n- **Integrity and anti‑corruption guardrails.**  \n  Detailed restrictions on conflicts of interest, transparency in subcontracting, requirements for performance reporting, and other integrity‑focused provisions often go beyond bare statutory minima. As these are shortened, sunsetted, or pushed into guidance, the informational and procedural scaffolding needed to detect corruption, self‑dealing, and waste is predictably eroded.\n\nThe pattern is unmistakable: in the name of “simplicity,” EO 14275 attacks precisely those parts of the procurement regime that protect workers, marginalized communities, small businesses, and the environment—while leaving intact the core mechanisms that deliver predictable revenue streams to large, incumbent contractors.\n\n#### d. Centralizing control over public contracts in the White House and OMB  \n\nEO 14275 does more than delete rules; it restructures power:\n\n- The EO vests OFPP, OMB, and the FAR Council—with leadership appointed by the President—with unprecedented, time‑compressed authority to determine which protections count as “essential.”  \n- Agency‑level “deregulatory liaisons” are embedded as enforcement arms, tasked explicitly with purging rules that do not conform to the minimalist creed.  \n- The RFO portal on Acquisition.gov, along with OMB memos and model deviations, has effectively displaced the Federal Register and the codified FAR as the primary source of procurement authority.\n\nThis is an institutional coup inside the machinery of government contracting. It pulls regulatory gravity toward the White House and OMB, shrinking the space for independent professional judgment and public oversight, and making it far easier to steer contracts—overtly or tacitly—toward favored firms and ideological allies.\n\n#### e. Regulatory sunsets and the ten‑for‑one straitjacket  \n\nFinally, EO 14275 hard‑wires deregulatory bias into the future:\n\n- **Four‑year sunsets** guarantee that even protections that survive the initial purge must fight for their lives every presidential term. Lapses in political will, bandwidth, or attention will automatically shrink the rulebook further.  \n- **The ten‑for‑one constraint** imported from EO 14192 functions as austerity for rules: each new protection must be “paid for” with a bonfire of ten existing provisions, regardless of public benefit.\n\nTogether, these design choices create a one‑way ratchet: protections can be rapidly dismantled but can only be rebuilt slowly, expensively, and precariously—if at all.\n\n---\n\n7. **Connection to Broader Agenda**  \n\nEO 14275 is not a technocratic footnote; it is a cornerstone of Trump’s second‑term project to deconstruct the regulatory state and refashion it as a pliant instrument of presidential and corporate power.\n\n- **Deconstructing the administrative state by executive fiat.**  \n  Rather than seeking statutory changes, the administration uses executive orders to rewire massive policy domains. EO 14275, like EO 14192, is an assertion that the president can unilaterally re‑engineer regulatory infrastructures built over decades—here, the entire federal procurement regime—without fresh legislation and with minimal public input.\n\n- **Weakening independent civil‑service governance.**  \n  By governing through OMB‑driven deviations and guidance instead of durable rules, the EO marginalizes the professional acquisition workforce’s role as stewards of public‑interest constraints. Career officials are pressured to implement deregulatory templates crafted at the political center, rather than to exercise judgment within a balanced framework that includes social, environmental, and equity objectives.\n\n- **Undercutting social and environmental policy through back doors.**  \n  Much contemporary public policy—living wages, nondiscrimination, climate resilience, local economic development—is implemented through contract conditions rather than standalone statutes. EO 14275 attacks this quiet backbone of social policy: by purging or destabilizing non‑statutory clauses, it weakens Congress’s and prior administrations’ choices without ever taking responsibility for repealing them in the open.\n\n- **Normalizing authoritarian methods.**  \n  When a president can, in a single stroke, launch a “revolutionary” rewrite of the rules governing nearly $1 trillion in spending, and then implement that rewrite via internal deviations and web portals before the public can meaningfully respond, the line between democratic governance and bureaucratic authoritarianism blurs. EO 14275 habituates agencies and contractors to the idea that fundamental rules can change overnight, by decree, at the whim of the executive.\n\nSeen in this light, EO 14275 is another front in a broader offensive: shrinking the welfare and regulatory state, eroding institutional checks, and re‑orienting the federal government around the priorities of large capital and presidential power rather than the common good.\n\n---\n\n8. **Harm Assessment**  \n\nThough still in early implementation, the EO’s architecture, class deviations, and agency supplements are already inflicting concrete damage and planting time bombs for the future.\n\n#### a. Immediate harms  \n\n1. **Opacity, confusion, and loss of legal recourse.**  \n   - Contractors and public‑interest advocates now confront a moving target: the operative text for many FAR parts lives in class deviations and RFO model language, rather than in the Code of Federal Regulations. GSA’s directive that its workforce follow RFO part‑25 model text “instead of” the codified FAR part is emblematic. ([gsa.gov](https://www.gsa.gov/policy-regulations/policy/acquisition-policy/acquisition-policy-library-and-resources/rfo202525?utm_source=openai))  \n   - Deviations and guidance documents are scattered across agency websites and often lack the clear, centralized notice and archival requirements of the Federal Register, making it harder for small businesses, watchdogs, and affected communities to know what rules apply.  \n   - Because many expectations are being shifted into non‑binding guidance, disappointed bidders, workers, and communities have fewer hard legal hooks on which to base protests and litigation, weakening accountability.\n\n2. **Erosion of small‑business and disadvantaged‑business opportunity.**  \n   - The official RFO emphasis on eliminating non‑statutory language, combined with reorganized small‑business rules, risks hollowing out the concrete steps agencies must take to discover and set aside work for small, women‑owned, minority‑owned, and veteran‑owned businesses.  \n   - Class deviations encourage greater reliance on large, flexible contract vehicles and “innovative” structures that favor incumbents with significant compliance infrastructure, raising barriers to entry for new and small vendors.  \n   - The resulting contraction in genuine small‑business competition will be felt most acutely in underserved regions and communities where federal contracts are a rare source of stable, middle‑class jobs.\n\n3. **Weakening of labor, equity, and environmental standards.**  \n   - As non‑statutory clauses are truncated, sunsetted, or offloaded into guidance, the contract‑based mechanisms that operationalize civil‑rights, labor‑rights, and environmental commitments lose bite.  \n   - Workers on federal projects—especially in services, construction, and logistics—face a greater risk of discrimination, unsafe conditions, union‑busting, and retaliation, with fewer contractual levers to demand change.  \n   - Vulnerable communities lose one of the few tools they had to push for cleaner, more resilient, and more equitable federal investments.\n\n4. **Heightened risk of cronyism and abuse, especially in emergencies.**  \n   - RFO‑driven deviations for emergency acquisitions and flexible contract types emphasize speed and “innovative” structures while cutting back on procedural detail. ([gsa.gov](https://www.gsa.gov/policy-regulations/policy/acquisition-policy/acquisition-policy-library-and-resources/rfo202518?utm_source=openai))  \n   - In crisis situations—disasters, pandemics, national security emergencies—where oversight is already strained, thinner, more discretionary rules are an engraved invitation to sweetheart deals, politically connected vendors, and rampant profiteering.\n\n#### b. Medium‑ and long‑term harms  \n\n1. **Entrenchment of corporate dominance and economic inequality.**  \n   A procurement regime that privileges large primes, streamlines away non‑statutory obligations, and destabilizes social‑policy clauses will, over time, further concentrate federal business in a shrinking circle of massive contractors. Small, local, and worker‑centered enterprises will find fewer pathways into the federal market, exacerbating regional inequality and closing off an important ladder of economic mobility for marginalized communities.\n\n2. **Enduring damage to democratic governance.**  \n   If governing by deviation, portal, and guidance instead of by stable, codified rules becomes normalized in procurement, the same logic can be exported to grants, benefits, and beyond. The cumulative effect is corrosive: major policy shifts become opaque, rapid, and effectively unreviewable; Congress’s intent is implemented or ignored at the pleasure of the executive; and the public’s ability to see, understand, and contest changes is steadily eroded.\n\n3. **Handcuffing future progressive administrations.**  \n   EO 14275 builds a deregulatory trap. Any administration that wants to use procurement as a lever for decarbonization, racial justice, worker power, or local economic development will first have to spend years reconstructing basic regulatory scaffolding just to regain the tools this order has stripped away. During that reconstruction, communities continue to absorb environmental damage, workplace exploitation, and lost opportunities—exactly the one‑way deregulatory ratchet this EO is designed to lock in.\n\n---\n\n9. **Reversal Strategy**  \n\nTo undo the damage of EO 14275 and rebuild a democratic, pro‑public procurement system, the next administration should move immediately on three fronts:\n\n1. **Immediate Revocation and Freeze.**  \n   On day one, issue a new executive order expressly revoking EO 14275 (and its deregulatory parent EO 14192), directing OFPP and the FAR Council to suspend all RFO‑related class deviations, and ordering agencies to revert to the pre‑RFO FAR text and agency supplements as an interim baseline pending comprehensive review. ([presidency.ucsb.edu](https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/executive-order-14275-restoring-common-sense-federal-procurement?utm_source=openai))  \n\n2. **APA‑Anchored Rebuild of the FAR with Strong Public‑Interest Mandates.**  \n   Direct the FAR Council, via a transparent OMB policy, to launch full notice‑and‑comment rulemaking that: (a) restores robust public‑participation and transparency provisions; (b) re‑codifies and strengthens small‑business and disadvantaged‑business access mechanisms; and (c) embeds explicit, enforceable clauses on labor standards, civil‑rights, climate and environmental stewardship, and community benefits across relevant FAR parts—drawing on independent legal analyses that already catalog the damage inflicted by the EO and the RFO. ([wiley.law](https://www.wiley.law/decoding-the-far-rewrite?utm_source=openai))  \n\n3. **Legislative Guardrails Against Future Autocratic Overhauls.**  \n   Work with Congress to amend core procurement statutes (including the provisions governing FAR issuance and deviations) to: (a) sharply limit the scope and duration of class deviations; (b) require that any major change to small‑business, labor, environmental, equity, or transparency rules undergo formal rulemaking; and (c) codify baseline social, labor, and climate‑related requirements in statute so they cannot be erased by executive whim. Parallel reforms should mandate meaningful representation of workers, small businesses, and impacted communities in advisory structures around the FAR Council.\n\nTaken together, these steps would not only reverse EO 14275’s damage but also build a more resilient procurement architecture—one that treats nearly a trillion dollars in annual federal spending as a lever for justice and shared prosperity, not as a spoils system for plutocrats and presidential loyalists.\n\nDoc B (id=B):\n1. **[Official Title]**: Executive Order 14275 – “Restoring Common Sense to Federal Procurement”  \n\n2. **Table of Contents**  \n- [Descriptive Title]  \n- What the EO Does  \n- Stated Purpose & Justification  \n- Nefarious Reality & True Impact  \n- Connection to Broader Agenda  \n- Harm Assessment  \n- Reversal Strategy  \n\n---\n\n3. **[Descriptive Title]**  \n\n“Rewriting the Rulebook in the Dark: The Procurement Deregulation Blitzkrieg for Corporate Favoritism”  \n\n---\n\n4. **What the EO Does**  \n\nFocusing strictly on its operative directives, EO 14275 does the following:\n\n- **Redefines the purpose of federal procurement regulation as radical minimalism.**  \n  It declares that the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) should contain *only* provisions required by statute or “essential to sound procurement,” and directs that other FAR provisions “should be removed.” ([federalregister.gov](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/04/18/2025-06839/restoring-common-sense-to-federal-procurement))  \n\n- **Orders a 180‑day purge and rewrite of the FAR.**  \n  It requires the Administrator of the Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP) (styled “Office of Federal Public Procurement Policy” in the order) and the FAR Council, working with agencies, to amend the FAR within 180 days so that it contains only statutorily required or narrowly defined “necessary” provisions. ([federalregister.gov](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/04/18/2025-06839/restoring-common-sense-to-federal-procurement))  \n\n- **Imposes a regulatory sunset on non‑statutory rules.**  \n  The order instructs OFPP and the FAR Council to (1) identify all non‑statutory FAR provisions that will be allowed to remain and (2) consider amending the FAR so that these provisions automatically *expire after four years* unless affirmatively renewed; the same sunset is to be considered for any new non‑statutory FAR provision going forward. ([federalregister.gov](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/04/18/2025-06839/restoring-common-sense-to-federal-procurement))  \n\n- **Compels every agency to embed a deregulatory liaison.**  \n  Within 15 days, each agency using the FAR must designate a senior acquisition official to work with OFPP and the FAR Council to “align” agency‑specific supplements with the EO’s deregulatory objectives and to identify provisions deemed inconsistent with the new minimalist policy. ([federalregister.gov](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/04/18/2025-06839/restoring-common-sense-to-federal-procurement))  \n\n- **Directs OMB to issue binding implementation guidance and extend “regulatory budgeting” into procurement.**  \n  Within 20 days, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), in consultation with OFPP, must issue a memorandum guiding implementation. That memo must promote “expedited and streamlined acquisitions” and apply the “ten‑for‑one” requirement from EO 14192—meaning new agency‑level requirements are conditioned on eliminating ten existing ones. ([federalregister.gov](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/04/18/2025-06839/restoring-common-sense-to-federal-procurement))  \n\n- **Authorizes immediate use of deviations and interim guidance to bypass normal rulemaking.**  \n  EO 14275 explicitly instructs OFPP and the FAR Council to issue “deviation and interim guidance” to implement its vision until final rules are published—opening the door to government‑wide “class deviations” that substitute new text for large portions of the FAR before any notice‑and‑comment rulemaking occurs. ([federalregister.gov](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/04/18/2025-06839/restoring-common-sense-to-federal-procurement))  \n\n- **Launches the “Revolutionary FAR Overhaul” (RFO) architecture in practice.**  \n  In execution, OMB and the FAR Council have created a centralized “Revolutionary FAR Overhaul” portal on Acquisition.gov, and are issuing model deviation texts to rewrite entire FAR Parts. Agencies such as HHS and GSA are adopting these via sweeping class deviations and overhauling their supplements (e.g., HHSAR) to track the new stripped‑down framework. ([hhs.gov](https://www.hhs.gov/grants-contracts/contracts/contract-policies-regulations/hhsar-overhaul/index.html))  \n\n---\n\n5. **Stated Purpose & Justification**  \n\nIn the administration’s own terms, EO 14275 presents itself as a technocratic efficiency measure:\n\n- **Diagnosis of a bloated, inefficient procurement system.**  \n  The order notes that the FAR has grown to more than 2,000 pages and portrays it as an “excessive and overcomplicated” framework that creates an “onerous bureaucracy.” It cites a 2024 Senate report (“Restoring Freedom’s Forge”) and the 2019 Advisory Panel on Streamlining and Codifying Acquisition Regulations as evidence that the FAR now *impedes* doing business with the government and hampers effective management of nearly $1 trillion in annual procurement spending. ([federalregister.gov](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/04/18/2025-06839/restoring-common-sense-to-federal-procurement))  \n\n- **Promise of agility, lower costs, and a bigger industrial base.**  \n  EO 14275 claims its goal is “the most agile, effective, and efficient procurement system possible,” arguing that eliminating “unnecessary” regulations will remove barriers to entry, expand the national and defense industrial base, and deliver better value for taxpayers. ([federalregister.gov](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/04/18/2025-06839/restoring-common-sense-to-federal-procurement))  \n\n- **Extension of a broader deregulation doctrine.**  \n  The order explicitly builds on EO 14192 (“Unleashing Prosperity Through Deregulation”), which established a deregulatory, “regulatory budget” posture for the executive branch. In procurement, this translates into the “ten‑for‑one” requirement and a presumption against non‑statutory regulatory text. ([federalregister.gov](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/04/18/2025-06839/restoring-common-sense-to-federal-procurement))  \n\n- **Framing the RFO as clean‑up and modernization.**  \n  Official materials from HHS, GSA, and private‑sector counsel frame the Revolutionary FAR Overhaul as a housekeeping exercise: removing duplicative or outdated clauses, simplifying structure, clarifying language, and moving detailed “how‑to” content into guidance while maintaining “essential” government‑wide standards. ([hhs.gov](https://www.hhs.gov/grants-contracts/contracts/contract-policies-regulations/hhsar-overhaul/index.html))  \n\nTaken at face value, the administration claims that EO 14275 simply rationalizes an unwieldy rulebook to speed acquisitions, reduce costs, and foster competition.  \n\n---\n\n6. **Nefarious Reality & True Impact**  \n\nBehind the anodyne language of “common sense” and “streamlining,” EO 14275 is a structural assault on democratic control of public money. It recenters power in the hands of a small White House–appointed procurement elite, strips away enforceable public‑interest rules, and rewires the procurement system to favor the largest, best‑connected contractors.\n\n#### a. Bypassing the Administrative Procedure Act and public participation  \n\nThe most insidious feature is *procedural*: EO 14275 explicitly green‑lights governing by “deviation and interim guidance” before any formal rulemaking. OMB’s follow‑on memo (M‑25‑25) and FAR Council guidance operationalize this as a two‑phase “deviate first, rulemake later” strategy:\n\n- Phase I: The FAR Council posts model FAR text and redlines on the RFO portal; agencies are told to implement them almost immediately through class deviations covering *entire classes of acquisitions*—not the limited, temporary exceptions class deviations were intended for.  \n- Phase II: Only later, after these deviations are entrenched as de facto law, will the Council undertake APA‑compliant notice‑and‑comment to formalize the changes.  \n\nAdvocacy analysis has documented in detail how this approach inverts the Administrative Procedure Act’s basic sequence—putting binding changes into effect *before* the public has a meaningful chance to comment, and often without any Federal Register notice at all for the deviations themselves. ([restorefairaccess.org](https://www.restorefairaccess.org/far-overhaul-watch))  \n\nEarly RFO releases go further by targeting the very sections of the FAR that guaranteed transparency and participation:\n\n- Revised FAR Part 1 removes the prior “Public Participation” subpart and weakens controls on the use of deviations, hollowing out the internal safeguards meant to stop exactly this kind of end‑run around formal rulemaking. ([restorefairaccess.org](https://www.restorefairaccess.org/far-overhaul-watch))  \n\nIn other words, EO 14275’s first real act is to dismantle the guardrails that protected stakeholders’ ability to contest changes—*before* the real purge begins.\n\n#### b. Substituting unenforceable “guidance” for binding rules  \n\nThe RFO architecture moves vast amounts of substantive content out of the FAR and into a thicket of non‑regulatory materials: “Strategic Acquisition Guidance” (SAG), “Practitioner Albums,” and “Buying Guides” curated by OFPP and the FAR Council. These documents explicitly disavow legal effect and are *not* intended to serve as a basis for protests or litigation. ([wiley.law](https://www.wiley.law/decoding-the-far-rewrite))  \n\nThis is a classic authoritarian move dressed up in management jargon:\n\n- When a requirement lives in the FAR, a contractor—or an affected community—can point to a specific clause, demand compliance, and, if necessary, seek redress through GAO or the courts.  \n- When the same expectation is relocated into a “guide” that “does not carry legal authority,” it becomes a suggestion. An agency can ignore it without consequence, and no one outside can compel adherence.\n\nBy relocating detail into soft law, the administration decouples procurement outcomes from any stable, enforceable standard and hands enormous discretionary power to agency officials—highly susceptible to political pressure.\n\n#### c. Systematic dismantling of small‑business, equity, and sustainability protections  \n\nThough EO 14275 never names them, the early RFO deviations make clear which policies are being placed on the chopping block:\n\n- **Small business participation.**  \n  RFO’s revised FAR Part 10 on market research strips out mandatory requirements to actively research small‑business capabilities and sets a new hierarchy that prioritizes existing government‑wide contracts. Analysts have correctly described this as a direct procedural attack on the “Rule of Two”—the central mechanism that triggers small‑business set‑asides when at least two capable small firms are identified. When agencies are no longer required to *look* for such firms, the trigger never fires, and set‑asides quietly evaporate. ([restorefairaccess.org](https://www.restorefairaccess.org/far-overhaul-watch))  \n\n- **Socioeconomic, labor, and environmental clauses.**  \n  Changes to FAR Part 52 have removed or weakened numerous non‑statutory clauses addressing equal employment opportunity, sustainability, and feedback from contractors, with the full redline not even made public. These are the very clauses that operationalized broad public‑policy aims—fair workplaces, greener supply chains, more accountable vendor relationships—in everyday contracts. Under the new dispensation, anything not anchored directly in statute is presumptively “non‑essential” and slotted for deletion or relegation to guidance. ([restorefairaccess.org](https://www.restorefairaccess.org/far-overhaul-watch))  \n\n- **Emergency and defense procurement guardrails.**  \n  Class deviations implementing the EO’s mandate are already rewriting FAR Parts dealing with emergency acquisitions, sealed bidding, contract types, and contract administration, emphasizing “flexibility,” higher thresholds, and “innovative” contract structures while reducing procedural detail and relocating key requirements to other parts or guidance. This is occurring through GSA and other agencies’ deviations that explicitly cite EO 14275 and the RFO initiative. ([gsa.gov](https://www.gsa.gov/policy-regulations/policy/acquisition-policy/acquisition-policy-library-and-resources/rfo202518?utm_source=openai))  \n\nThe pattern is unmistakable: rules that protect small businesses, workers, and communities are being thinned out, scattered into non‑binding documents, or erased outright—not because Congress repealed them, but because a presidential decree reclassified them as expendable.\n\n#### d. Centralizing control over nearly $1 trillion in spending  \n\nEO 14275’s 180‑day mandate, combined with the requirement that every agency install a deregulatory liaison and obey OMB/OFPP guidance, centralizes control over procurement regulation in the White House and a small cadre of procurement policy officials. Meanwhile, the RFO website and deviation regime effectively relocate the authoritative version of procurement rules from the public, codified FAR to an executive‑branch portal managed under presidential direction. ([hhs.gov](https://www.hhs.gov/grants-contracts/contracts/contract-policies-regulations/hhsar-overhaul/index.html))  \n\nThis is not neutral “management reform.” It is a consolidation of power over contract rules and, by extension, over who receives the government’s business. Once procedural guardrails and public‑law anchors are removed, it becomes far easier to:\n\n- Steer large, opaque vehicles toward politically favored firms;  \n- Punish contractors whose labor, environmental, or speech practices displease the administration;  \n- Sideline watchdogs and litigants by depriving them of concrete regulatory hooks.\n\nIn sum, EO 14275 functions as a systemic dismantling of public, legally enforceable procurement rules and their replacement with centralized, discretionary control—a textbook move toward bureaucratic authoritarianism within the contracting system.  \n\n---\n\n7. **Connection to Broader Agenda**  \n\nEO 14275 is not an isolated curiosity; it is a pillar of the administration’s broader project to deconstruct the regulatory state and rebuild it as an instrument of presidential and corporate power.\n\n- **Extension of deregulation-by-quota into the core machinery of the state.**  \n  EO 14192’s deregulation “budget” and ten‑for‑one requirement are extended into procurement through EO 14275, turning the FAR into an object of ongoing subtraction. Instead of asking what rules are needed to protect workers, communities, or the climate, the question becomes: *What can we get away with deleting while still technically complying with statutes?* ([federalregister.gov](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/04/18/2025-06839/restoring-common-sense-to-federal-procurement))  \n\n- **Eroding independent administration and legal constraints.**  \n  By sidelining APA processes and moving substance into soft law, EO 14275 advances the longstanding Trumpist ambition to weaken independent civil‑service–driven governance and replace it with a system where loyalty and personal alignment with the president matter more than adherence to codified standards. The FAR used to embody a balance between efficiency, public policy objectives, and public trust; the EO deliberately foregrounds “efficiency” while treating those other pillars as dispensable.  \n\n- **Undercutting social safety nets and public‑interest mandates via procurement.**  \n  Much of modern U.S. social and environmental policy is implemented not only through direct regulation but also through contract conditions: living‑wage clauses, equal‑opportunity commitments, Buy American and anti‑offshoring rules, climate‑related requirements for major infrastructure and IT projects, set‑asides for disadvantaged businesses. By labeling most such provisions “non‑essential” and migrating them to non‑binding guidance, EO 14275 pre‑emptively weakens any future administration’s ability to use procurement as a lever for climate action, racial justice, or labor standards—directly serving a reactionary agenda hostile to those aims.  \n\n- **Normalizing executive fiat over legislative policy.**  \n  EO 14275 enables sweeping changes to procurement rules governing close to a trillion dollars annually, without new legislation and largely without public input. It thereby accustoms the system—agencies, contractors, Congress—to the idea that the occupant of the Oval Office can rewire enormous economic domains by decree, a hallmark of creeping authoritarian governance.  \n\nTogether with attacks on civil‑service protections, environmental and labor regulations, and voting rights, EO 14275 is best understood as another front in a coordinated offensive to weaken institutional checks and make the state an obedient vehicle for a narrow economic and ideological bloc.  \n\n---\n\n8. **Harm Assessment**  \n\nAlthough EO 14275 is still in its first year, the architecture it has set in motion is already inflicting concrete damage and poses grave medium‑ and long‑term risks.\n\n#### a. Immediate harms (already observable)  \n\n1. **Loss of transparency and legal recourse.**  \n   - Agencies are issuing broad class deviations that replace entire FAR Parts (e.g., on market research, emergency acquisitions, sealed bidding, contract types, and administration) with RFO model text, often with minimal public explanation and no formal APA docket.  \n   - Stakeholders attempting to understand applicable rules now must chase evolving deviation documents and non‑binding guidance scattered across Acquisition.gov, HHS, GSA, and other agency sites; many are not subject to the same archiving and comment requirements as the Federal Register. ([hhs.gov](https://www.hhs.gov/grants-contracts/contracts/contract-policies-regulations/hhsar-overhaul/index.html))  \n   - Because key expectations now live in documents that “do not carry legal authority,” contractors and public‑interest groups have far weaker grounds to challenge unfair or discriminatory decisions in bid protests or court. ([wiley.law](https://www.wiley.law/decoding-the-far-rewrite))  \n\n2. **Erosion of small‑business access, especially for disadvantaged firms.**  \n   - The weakening of mandatory small‑business market research obligations in FAR Part 10, combined with guidance that prioritizes existing large contract vehicles, will predictably reduce the number of procurements set aside for small firms—including those owned by women, people of color, veterans, and firms in underserved communities that disproportionately rely on federal contracting for stable revenue. ([restorefairaccess.org](https://www.restorefairaccess.org/far-overhaul-watch))  \n   - For disadvantaged businesses, the practical effect is fewer opportunities to prime contracts and greater dependence on subcontracts with major primes, where margins and bargaining power are far worse. This accelerates existing trends of consolidation and the shrinking number of distinct small‑business vendors in the federal marketplace.  \n\n3. **Weakening of EEO, labor, and environmental protections in contracts.**  \n   - With non‑statutory equal‑opportunity, sustainability, and worker‑feedback clauses removed or downgraded in Part 52, agencies now have far less consistent, enforceable language to require fair employment practices, to demand climate‑responsible performance, or to systematize engagement with workers and communities. ([restorefairaccess.org](https://www.restorefairaccess.org/far-overhaul-watch))  \n   - Vulnerable workers—especially those employed by service, construction, and logistics contractors—face greater exposure to discrimination, unsafe conditions, and retaliation, because the contractual hooks that once operationalized broader civil‑rights and labor commitments are attenuated.  \n\n4. **Risk of cronyism and corruption in emergency and defense spending.**  \n   - By streamlining emergency acquisition rules (FAR Part 18) and emphasizing flexible “innovative” contracting (Part 16) while simultaneously thinning procedural guardrails and public‑participation structures, the EO creates fertile ground for sweetheart deals during crises—exactly when oversight is already strained. ([gsa.gov](https://www.gsa.gov/policy-regulations/policy/acquisition-policy/acquisition-policy-library-and-resources/rfo202518?utm_source=openai))  \n\n#### b. Medium‑ and long‑term harms  \n\n1. **Structural entrenchment of corporate power and inequality.**  \n   Over time, a procurement regime that privileges large, government‑wide vehicles; minimizes market research for small firms; and moves pro‑equity and pro‑environment policies into non‑binding guidance will cement the dominance of large incumbents—especially in defense, IT, and health care—at the expense of local, minority‑owned, and worker‑centered enterprises. The result is deeper regional inequality and fewer pathways for marginalized communities to access stable, high‑quality jobs funded by federal dollars.  \n\n2. **Lasting damage to democratic governance.**  \n   If left in place, the RFO model will normalize governing by deviation and soft law, making it vastly easier for future presidents to rewrite crucial regulatory infrastructures without Congress and largely without the APA. Procurement is only the test case; similar logic could be spread to grants, benefits administration, and beyond. This corrodes the very idea that major policy shifts should be deliberate, transparent, and legally contestable.  \n\n3. **Handcuffing future progressive administrations.**  \n   A successor administration seeking to use procurement to accelerate decarbonization, strengthen labor standards, or close racial wealth gaps will first have to spend years reconstructing basic regulatory scaffolding that EO 14275 is now tearing down. In the meantime, damage to workers, communities, and the climate accumulates—precisely the one‑way ratchet toward deregulatory plutocracy that this order is designed to achieve.  \n\n---\n\n9. **Reversal Strategy**  \n\nTo undo the damage from EO 14275 and rebuild a democratic, pro‑public procurement system, the next administration should move on at least the following three fronts:\n\n1. **Immediate Revocation and Freeze.**  \n   - On day one, issue a new Executive Order expressly revoking EO 14275 (and its deregulatory parent EO 14192), directing OFPP and the FAR Council to suspend all RFO‑related class deviations, and ordering agencies to revert to the pre‑RFO FAR text and supplements pending comprehensive review. ([federalregister.gov](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/04/18/2025-06839/restoring-common-sense-to-federal-procurement))  \n\n2. **APA‑Anchored Rebuild of the FAR With Stronger Public‑Interest Mandates.**  \n   - Direct the FAR Council, via OMB guidance, to undertake a full, transparent rulemaking—through the Federal Register and 41 U.S.C. §1707—to (a) restore and strengthen public‑participation provisions and constraints on deviations; (b) re‑codify robust small‑business market‑research and Rule‑of‑Two triggers; and (c) embed explicit, enforceable clauses on equal employment, labor standards, climate and environmental stewardship, and community benefits into FAR Parts 19, 22–24, 26, 36–37, and 52. ([restorefairaccess.org](https://www.restorefairaccess.org/far-overhaul-watch))  \n\n3. **Legislative Safeguards Against Future Autocratic Procurement Overhauls.**  \n   - Work with Congress to amend core procurement statutes—especially 41 U.S.C. §1707 and related provisions—to (a) sharply limit the scope and duration of class deviations; (b) require that any major change to small‑business, labor, environmental, or transparency rules undergo formal notice‑and‑comment; (c) mandate small‑business and worker representation in the FAR Council; and (d) codify baseline social and environmental contract requirements so they cannot be erased by a single Executive Order. ([restorefairaccess.org](https://www.restorefairaccess.org/far-overhaul-watch))  \n\nTaken together, these steps would not only reverse EO 14275’s damage but also build a more resilient, democratically governed procurement system—one less vulnerable to the next deregulatory or authoritarian administration bent on turning public contracts into a private spoils system.\n\n\nPairwise evaluation payload placeholder."
