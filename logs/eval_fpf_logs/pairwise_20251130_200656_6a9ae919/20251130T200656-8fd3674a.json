Reversal Strategy\n\n[Descriptive Title]\nThe Disciplinary Chilling Effect: Reinstating Punitive and Racially Biased School-to-Prison Pipeline Policies\n\nWhat the EO Does\nExecutive Order 14280, signed on April 23, 2025, represents a draconian directive aimed at fundamentally altering school disciplinary practices across the United States. Specifically, the order:\n*   Declares that the federal government will no longer tolerate school discipline based on \"discriminatory and unlawful 'equity' ideology,\" which it claims poses risks to children's safety and well-being.\n*   Directs the U.S. Department of Education (ED) to issue new guidance within 30 days, instructing local educational agencies (LEAs) and state educational agencies (SEAs) on school discipline without reliance on \"disparate impact theory\" to address racial disparities.\n*   Mandates that federal agencies ensure disciplinary decisions are not guided by \"equity mandates\" perceived as undermining local control or school safety.\n*   Requires the ED Secretary to take \"appropriate action\" against LEAs and SEAs failing to comply with Title VI protections against racial discrimination, reinterpreting \"racial discrimination\" to challenge equity-oriented practices designed to address disparities affecting students of color.\n*   Instructs the ED Secretary and U.S. Attorney General to coordinate with governors and state attorneys general within 60 days to design guidance for school discipline policies that reject \"equity-based approaches\" and promote \"race-neutral standards\".\n*   Orders the Secretary of Defense to issue a revised school discipline code for military-service families within 90 days, promoting \"common sense,\" safety, and \"American values and traditional virtues\" without \"unlawful discrimination\".\n*   Demands a report within 120 days from the Secretaries of Education, Health and Human Services, Homeland Security, and the Attorney General to the President, detailing the \"status of discriminatory-equity-ideology-based school discipline and behavior modification techniques\" and reviewing Title VI discipline-related investigations since 2009. The report must also identify federally funded non-profit organizations supporting \"discriminatory equity ideologies\" and propose preventing federal funds from such practices.\n\nStated Purpose & Justification\nThe Trump administration publicly justifies Executive Order 14280 as a necessary measure to \"ensure safety and order in American classrooms\" and to prevent the application of school discipline based on \"discriminatory and unlawful 'equity' ideology\". The order asserts that previous \"equity-based\" approaches, particularly those rooted in disparate impact theory, \"required schools to discriminate on the basis of race by imposing discipline based on racial characteristics, rather than on objective behavior alone\". It claims that such policies led to schools ignoring or covering up student misconduct to avoid purported racial disparities, thereby making classrooms less safe. The stated goal is to restore \"common sense\" to school discipline, emphasize student safety, and uphold \"American values and traditional virtues\" by empowering local control and focusing on \"objective behavior\" rather than \"racial statistics\".\n\nNefarious Reality & True Impact\nThe \"commonsense\" veneer of Executive Order 14280 thinly masks a nefarious reality: a calculated, systemic dismantling of civil rights protections in education and the exacerbation of the school-to-prison pipeline for marginalized youth. This executive order is a direct assault on the fundamental principle of educational equity, systematically weakening democratic institutions by centralizing punitive power and eroding federal oversight designed to protect vulnerable student populations. By explicitly rejecting disparate impact analysis, the administration strips away one of the most critical legal tools for identifying and remedying systemic racial bias in school discipline. This effectively legitimizes discriminatory practices under the guise of \"race-neutrality,\" ignoring overwhelming evidence that such \"neutrality\" allows deeply unequal outcomes to persist, disproportionately harming Black, Latino, and Native American students.\n\nThe order advances a dictatorial agenda by empowering state and local authorities to implement punitive, exclusionary discipline without federal accountability, thereby ensuring the subjugation of students of color to harsher treatment for similar behaviors compared to their white peers. This institutional erosion undermines accountability for systemic racism, fostering environments where implicit bias can flourish unchecked. The beneficiaries are not the public good, but rather ideological groups committed to a \"colorblind\" narrative that dismisses structural inequalities and a carceral system that profits from the increased incarceration rates fueled by the school-to-prison pipeline. This shift in policy ensures that power remains concentrated in the hands of those who prioritize punitive measures over restorative justice, further entrenching educational disparities that serve to maintain existing social hierarchies.\n\nConnection to Broader Agenda\nExecutive Order 14280 is not an isolated incident but a critical component of the Trump administration's broader, authoritarian agenda aimed at dismantling civil rights, eroding safety nets, and accelerating systemic suffering, all under the guise of \"restoring order\" and \"American values.\" This executive order aligns seamlessly with Executive Order 14190, \"Restoring the Rule of Law and Eliminating Harmful Equity Ideology,\" which broadly attacks race-conscious frameworks across federal policy, revealing a coordinated effort to whitewash systemic inequality. By removing federal mechanisms to address racial disparities in school discipline, the administration actively fosters environments where educational apartheid can flourish, pushing more vulnerable children, particularly Black and Indigenous youth, out of classrooms and into the juvenile justice system. This action directly contributes to the erosion of educational safety nets, creating hostile learning environments that disproportionately deny opportunities to students already facing immense social and economic hurdles. It is a calculated move to reinforce existing power structures, ensuring that the burden of systemic failures falls squarely on the shoulders of the most vulnerable, while corporations and ideological groups benefit from the resulting societal stratification and reduced social mobility.\n\nHarm Assessment\nThe tangible negative consequences of Executive Order 14280 are devastating and far-reaching, fundamentally harming vulnerable populations, exacerbating economic inequality, and diminishing fundamental rights. By systematically removing federal oversight and encouraging \"race-neutral\" policies that disregard disparate impact, the order ensures an inevitable surge in exclusionary discipline practices such as suspensions and expulsions, disproportionately targeting Black, Latino, and Native American students, as well as students with disabilities. These punitive measures directly fuel the school-to-prison pipeline, tearing students away from learning environments and dramatically increasing their likelihood of academic failure, dropping out, and subsequent entanglement with the criminal justice system.\n\nThe historical data is unambiguous: even for similar behaviors, students of color are subjected to harsher and more frequent punishments than their white peers. This executive order will only deepen these pre-existing disparities, leading to a profound loss of instructional time and severely curtailing educational attainment, thereby widening the achievement gap and perpetuating cycles of poverty and incarceration across generations. The psychological toll on marginalized students, subjected to such systemic prejudice, cannot be overstated, contributing to feelings of alienation and distrust in public institutions. Economically, the increase in school push-outs will lead to a less educated workforce, reduced economic mobility, and increased societal costs associated with incarceration and social services, further entrenching economic inequality. This executive order is not merely a policy change; it is an act of institutionalized cruelty that systematically denies fundamental rights to education and equal protection under the law for millions of children.\n\nReversal Strategy\n1.  **Issue a new Executive Order:** The next administration must immediately issue an executive order rescinding EO 14280 and proactively reinstating prior guidance that recognizes and addresses racial disparities in school discipline, emphasizing the importance of disparate impact analysis in civil rights enforcement.\n2.  **Reinstate and Expand Department of Education Guidance:** The Department of Education, in coordination with the Department of Justice, should swiftly reinstate the 2014 \"Dear Colleague\" letter (or updated equivalent) and develop robust, evidence-based guidance that promotes restorative justice, culturally responsive practices, and data-driven approaches to reduce exclusionary discipline for all students, with particular attention to historically marginalized groups.\n3.  **Prioritize Federal Funding for Equity Initiatives:** Direct federal funding and grant programs towards school districts and states that implement comprehensive equity-centered discipline reforms, invest in implicit bias training for educators, and actively track and address racial disparities in disciplinary outcomes, ensuring accountability through federal civil rights investigations where necessary.\n\nDoc B (id=B):\n## 1.

What the EO Does\n\nFactual description of the operative directives of EO 14280, stripped of propaganda but faithful to the text. ([presidency.ucsb.edu](https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/executive-order-14280-reinstating-common-sense-school-discipline-policies?utm_source=openai))  \n\n- **Reframes civil-rights enforcement as an attack on “equity ideology.”**  \n  - Declares that classroom safety is threatened by discipline policies “based on discriminatory and unlawful ‘equity’ ideology,” explicitly targeting disparate-impact–based efforts to reduce racial discipline gaps under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act.  \n  - Portrays the 2014 Obama-era “Dear Colleague” guidance on school discipline, and Biden-era 2023 guidance, as forcing schools to discriminate “on the basis of race” to equalize suspension rates.  \n\n- **Orders new federal discipline guidance that repudiates disparate-impact analysis.**  \n  - Within 30 days, the Secretary of Education, “in consultation with the Attorney General,” must issue new guidance to state and local education agencies on school discipline and Title VI obligations.  \n  - This guidance is explicitly framed to reject “equity ideology” and statistical disparity analysis as bases for finding discrimination, replacing them with a narrow, formal “objective behavior only” lens.  \n\n- **Threatens enforcement against districts that continue equity-based discipline reforms.**  \n  - Directs the Secretary of Education to “take appropriate action” against state and local agencies that purportedly fail to comply with Title VI “protections against racial discrimination” in discipline—functionally aimed at districts that use race-conscious data and equity frameworks, not at districts that actually over‑punish students of color.  \n\n- **Mobilizes federal–state alignment against equity-oriented discipline.**  \n  - Within 60 days, requires the Secretary of Education and Attorney General to coordinate with governors and state attorneys general to “prevent racial discrimination” in discipline—coded language for organizing state-level resistance to equity‑oriented reforms and tying civil-rights enforcement to an anti‑equity, “race-neutral” dogma.  \n\n- **Extends the regime to Pentagon‑run schools.**  \n  - Within 90 days, orders the Secretary of Defense to issue a revised discipline code for Department of Defense Education Activity (DoDEA) schools, ensuring children of military families are governed by the same anti‑equity discipline framework.  \n\n- **Mandates a sweeping, ideologically filtered national report and model policies.**  \n  - Within 120 days, the Secretary of Education, in coordination with the Attorney General, HHS, and DHS, must submit a report inventorying:  \n    - All Title VI discipline-related investigations since 2009;  \n    - The role of federally funded nonprofits in promoting equity-based discipline and “behavior modification techniques”;  \n    - Recommendations so that federal funds do **not** support such programs; and  \n    - **“Model” school discipline policies** that “do not promote unlawful discrimination,” are “rooted in American values and traditional virtues,” and explicitly exclude “discriminatory equity ideology.”  \n\n- **Anchors itself in earlier anti‑DEI orders.**  \n  - Cross‑references Trump’s earlier EO on K–12 “radical indoctrination” (EO 14190), importing its definitions of “equity ideology” and thereby tying all future discipline guidance and enforcement to a broad assault on any race-conscious or DEI‑oriented practice in schools. ([presidency.ucsb.edu](https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/executive-order-14280-reinstating-common-sense-school-discipline-policies?utm_source=openai))  \n\n- **Creates a platform for legislative entrenchment.**  \n  - Congressional allies have already introduced bills (e.g., H.R. 3801, “EO 14280 Act of 2025,” and H.R. 4728) to codify EO 14280 so that its anti‑equity discipline framework would outlive Trump’s term and become statutory law. ([congress.gov](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/3801/text?utm_source=openai))  \n\n\n## 5. Stated Purpose & Justification\n\nTrump’s public rationale, as articulated in the Federal Register text and a White House fact sheet, can be summarized as follows. ([whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/04/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-reinstates-commonsense-school-discipline-policies/?utm_source=openai))  \n\n- **Claim: “Restoring safety and order” to classrooms.**  \n  The EO declares that schools have become unsafe because equity-oriented discipline reforms allegedly pressured administrators to ignore or under‑punish serious misbehavior, leaving “dangerous” students in classrooms and increasing violence and disorder. It asserts that the federal government will “no longer tolerate known risks to children’s safety and well-being” caused by such policies.  \n\n- **Claim: Obama/Biden “weaponized” Title VI through disparate-impact.**  \n  The order denounces the 2014 Obama ED/DOJ “Dear Colleague” letter and the Biden administration’s 2023 guidance for using disparate-impact analysis—that is, treating large racial disparities in discipline as potential evidence of discrimination—as unlawful “equity ideology.” It frames this as racial preferencing: punishing white students more or Black students less to equalize the numbers.  \n\n- **Claim: Equity reforms force “racial discrimination” and undermine merit.**  \n  EO 14280 states that equity-driven discipline requires decision-makers to consider race rather than “objective behavior,” insisting this is itself a violation of Title VI. The fact sheet insists that Trump is “reinstating commonsense, non-discriminatory school discipline policies” and eliminating “racially preferential discipline practices.” ([whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/04/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-reinstates-commonsense-school-discipline-policies/?utm_source=openai))  \n\n- **Claim: Empowering local teachers and administrators.**  \n  The White House argues that by eliminating federal scrutiny based on racial disparities and abolishing “equity ideology,” teachers and principals will regain freedom to discipline “based on conduct” rather than “statistics,” supposedly increasing safety and academic achievement.  \n\nIn short, the official justification is a familiar law‑and‑order narrative: equity reforms are painted as dangerous, ideologically extreme, and racially discriminatory, while aggressive, ostensibly “colorblind” punishment is recast as both neutral and necessary.  \n\n\n## 6. Nefarious Reality & True Impact\n\nBehind the soothing rhetoric of “commonsense” and “safety,” EO 14280 is a calculated strike on civil-rights enforcement in schools and a direct assault on any attempt to confront the racialized reality of discipline.  \n\n### 6.1 Turning Civil-Rights Law Upside Down\n\n- **From protecting marginalized students to protecting white resentment.**  \n  For decades, investigations and data have documented that Black, Indigenous, and Latino students—especially boys, students with disabilities, and LGBTQ+ youth—are punished more harshly than white peers for the same conduct. Equity-based reforms sought to reduce these disparities and hold districts accountable. EO 14280 brands these remedial efforts as the *real* discrimination, twisting Title VI from a shield for vulnerable students into a sword against racial-justice work. ([racism.org](https://racism.org/trump-admin/12669-executive-order-14280?utm_source=openai))  \n\n- **Crippling disparate-impact enforcement.**  \n  By design, the order delegitimizes the use of racial disparity data as evidence that facially neutral policies may be discriminatory in practice. This neuters one of the few tools available to challenge systemic bias where no “smoking gun” racist statement exists—which is precisely how modern discrimination often operates.  \n\n### 6.2 Chilling Equity Work Nationwide\n\n- **Signaling that equity itself is suspect.**  \n  The EO’s terminology—“discriminatory equity ideology,” “behavior modification techniques”—is left intentionally vague. This vagueness is not an accident; it maximizes fear. Districts do not know what practices might be targeted, so they have a strong incentive to abandon *any* program or training that mentions race, trauma‑informed practice, restorative justice, or implicit bias. Legal commentators note that the order misrepresents educational research and leaves districts with only a hazy sense of what is permissible, thereby chilling local initiatives to reduce unfair discipline disparities. ([aalrr.com](https://www.aalrr.com/newsroom-alerts-4151?utm_source=openai))  \n\n- **Weaponizing federal funds.**  \n  By ordering an “inventory” of Title VI investigations and a review of nonprofit grantees, the EO sets up a blacklist process aimed at cutting off federal funding for organizations that support restorative or equity‑centered discipline practices (e.g., anti‑suspension coalitions, racial-justice education nonprofits). This is designed to starve the ecosystem that has been painstakingly built over the past decade to dismantle the school‑to‑prison pipeline. ([presidency.ucsb.edu](https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/executive-order-14280-reinstating-common-sense-school-discipline-policies?utm_source=openai))  \n\n### 6.3 Centralizing Ideological Control Under the Guise of “Local Authority”\n\nAlthough framed as deference to local control, EO 14280 is in fact a **federal ideological mandate**:\n\n- It **prescribes** a single, right‑wing reading of Title VI—where “race‑neutral” appearance always trumps racially disparate reality—and imposes that interpretation through guidance, enforcement threats, and model policies.  \n- It explicitly imports the vocabulary and definitions of Trump’s anti‑DEI EO 14190, binding K–12 discipline to a broader federal project of eradicating “equity ideology” across education programs. ([brookings.edu](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/the-status-of-litigation-against-the-trump-administrations-k-12-education-agenda-a-guide-for-education-leaders/?utm_source=openai))  \n- It reaches into federally operated schools (DoDEA) and presses state attorneys general into service, using the machinery of the state to enforce culture‑war doctrine.  \n\nThis is not deregulation; it is **ideological centralization**—regulation in service of a reactionary project.  \n\n### 6.4 Laying the Groundwork for Permanent Statutory Change\n\nThe fact that multiple House bills have been introduced to **codify EO 14280**—giving it “the force and effect of law” and making its language the permanent statutory baseline—demonstrates the broader agenda: to make anti‑equity discipline policy durable beyond a single administration. ([congress.gov](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/3801/text?utm_source=openai))  \n\nThis move would:  \n\n- Lock in a narrow, colorblind definition of discrimination in education;  \n- Strip future administrations of flexibility to restore robust Title VI enforcement; and  \n- Normalize the punishment of districts that dare to take racial disparities seriously.  \n\nIn sum, EO 14280 is a structurally sophisticated attempt to **invert civil-rights law**, delegitimize equity work, and entrench punitive, exclusionary discipline as the federal norm.  \n\n\n## 7. Connection to Broader Agenda\n\nEO 14280 is not an isolated outburst; it is a cog in a much larger machine.\n\n- **Part of a coordinated anti‑DEI offensive.**  \n  Trump’s second-term executive orders form a coherent suite of anti‑equity measures: EO 14151 dismantling federal DEI programs, EO 14173 rebranding affirmative efforts as “illegal discrimination,” EO 14190 targeting “radical indoctrination in K–12 schooling,” and EO 14191 promoting “educational freedom” (voucherization and privatization). EO 14280 plugs directly into this architecture by targeting discipline, a key lever of racialized control in schools. ([first100days.info](https://www.first100days.info/executive_orders.php?utm_source=openai))  \n\n- **Synergy with EO 14281 (meritocracy and Title VI).**  \n  Analysts have highlighted that EO 14280 was issued alongside EO 14281, which attacks the use of disparate impact analysis under Title VI more broadly. Together, these orders gut the ability of federal agencies to combat discriminatory effects, not just in discipline but across civil-rights enforcement.

This is textbook authoritarian strategy:  \n  - Define a marginalized population (here, disproportionately Black and Brown youth) as a threat to public order;  \n  - Smear institutions and reforms that protect them as extremists;  \n  - Use the language of “safety” and “commonsense” to justify centralized crackdowns.  \n\n- **Constraining future democratic choice.**  \n  By seeking codification in Congress and rewriting the interpretive baseline for Title VI, the Trump administration aims to **tie the hands of future elected governments**, forcing them to operate within a narrow, racially evasive framework even if the electorate demands robust racial justice in schools. This is an archetypal feature of creeping authoritarianism: making reactionary policy “sticky” and difficult to dismantle through ordinary democratic turnover.  \n\nUltimately, EO 14280 is an education-sector embodiment of the broader Trumpist project: weaponize the state against marginalized communities, criminalize equity, and rebrand reactionary hierarchy as “neutral” law.  \n\n\n## 8. Harm Assessment\n\n### 8.1 Racialized Discipline and the School-to-Prison Pipeline\n\nPre‑existing data (before Trump’s second term) already showed that Black students were suspended and expelled at several times the rate of white students, even when controlling for behavior, disability, and poverty. Equity-focused initiatives—restorative justice, tiered interventions, implicit-bias training, revised codes of conduct—were designed to blunt that reality. EO 14280 places all of these reforms under suspicion.\n\nAnticipated and emerging harms:\n\n- **Increased suspensions, expulsions, and police referrals for students of color.**  \n  Administrators now know that *reducing* racial gaps can invite federal scrutiny, while ignoring them is legally “safe.” The rational institutional response is to abandon gap‑reduction goals and revert to maximal exclusion, particularly in districts already hostile to racial justice.\n\n- **Expansion of exclusionary practices in DoD schools.**  \n  Military-connected students (disproportionately low‑income, often students of color) will be subjected to harsher codes of conduct stripped of trauma‑informed or restorative safeguards, compounding stress and instability in families already under strain.  \n\n- **Entrenchment of the school‑to‑prison pipeline.**  \n  Decades of research tie early suspensions, expulsions, and school policing to later justice-system involvement, lower graduation rates, and diminished earnings. EO 14280 pushes systems back toward zero‑tolerance paradigms that we know feed this pipeline, under cover of “commonsense.” ([racism.org](https://racism.org/trump-admin/12669-executive-order-14280?utm_source=openai))  \n\n### 8.2 Chilling Effect on Educators and Districts\n\n- **Suppression of restorative and trauma‑informed practices.**  \n  Because the order demonizes “behavior modification techniques” linked even rhetorically to equity, districts will be wary of funding social‑emotional learning, restorative circles, or culturally responsive classroom management—despite substantial evidence that these approaches improve climate and achievement without increasing racial disparities.  \n\n- **Targeting civil-rights compliance officers and equity staff.**  \n  Staff whose job is to monitor discipline data and coordinate interventions to address disparities become politically and legally precarious. Their reports and interventions can now be painted as “evidence” of illegal equity ideology, making it easier to abolish those positions or sideline their work.  \n\n### 8.3 Legal and Administrative Chaos\n\n- **Conflicting federal and state frameworks.**  \n  States like California, which have passed laws limiting suspensions for “willful defiance” (e.g., SB 274) and encouraging non‑punitive responses, now find their policy direction at odds with federal guidance. Districts are left to navigate conflicting commands: state law pushing them toward restorative approaches, federal rhetoric warning that equity‑inflected discipline may violate Title VI. Legal analyses already flag this tension and forecast disputes over compliance and liability. ([aalrr.com](https://www.aalrr.com/newsroom-alerts-4151?utm_source=openai))  \n\n- **Increased litigation risk for districts trying to do the right thing.**  \n  Districts committed to racial justice face a new legal landscape in which parents’ groups and right‑wing legal organizations can invoke EO 14280 to claim that modest equity measures are racially discriminatory. Even if such suits ultimately fail, the threat itself exerts a powerful deterrent effect, consuming time, money, and political capital.  \n\n### 8.4 Psychological and Civic Harm\n\n- **Delegitimizing the lived experience of students of color.**  \n  By labeling efforts to address documented racial disparities as discrimination, the EO effectively tells Black and Brown students that their experiences of bias are illegitimate and that attempts to remedy injustice are racist. This distorts civic understanding and deepens mistrust of institutions.  \n\n- **Normalizing state hostility to equity language.**  \n  Young people are learning that the federal government equates “equity” with illegality. This is not just policy; it is civic pedagogy—teaching a generation that striving to correct structural injustice is itself suspicious, dangerous, even unlawful. That lesson will reverberate far beyond school discipline into how youth understand democracy, protest, and solidarity.  \n\n\n## 9. Reversal Strategy\n\nTo undo the damage of EO 14280, a future administration must treat it not as an isolated policy tweak but as part of a broader anti‑equity constitutional project. At minimum:\n\n1. **Immediate Rescission and Replacement Guidance.**  \n   - On day one, issue an executive order revoking EO 14280 and any guidance derived from it; direct ED and DOJ to restore and update robust Title VI enforcement, explicitly reinstating disparate-impact analysis in school discipline and re‑affirming districts’ authority to pursue equity‑oriented reforms consistent with civil-rights law.  \n\n2. **Legislative Codification of Anti‑Discrimination Standards That Include Disparate Impact.**  \n   - Work with Congress to enact legislation (e.g., a “School Civil Rights and Equity Act”) that explicitly incorporates disparate-impact standards into Title VI for K–12 and higher education, codifies protections for voluntary equity initiatives, and bars any future administration from treating efforts to reduce racial disparities as per se discriminatory. ([brookings.edu](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/the-status-of-litigation-against-the-trump-administrations-k-12-education-agenda-a-guide-for-education-leaders/?utm_source=openai))  \n\n3. **Rebuild and Fund an Equity‑Centered Discipline Infrastructure.**  \n   - Through regulation and appropriations, require transparent reporting of discipline data disaggregated by race, disability, gender, and other key factors; expand OCR’s capacity to investigate discriminatory discipline; and create major grant programs supporting restorative justice, trauma‑informed practice, and community‑based alternatives to exclusion—explicitly prioritizing districts that dismantle exclusionary practices reinforced by EO 14280.  \n\nTaken together, these steps would not only reverse EO 14280 but also seize the opportunity to **re‑inscribe a proactive, equity‑based vision of civil-rights enforcement in education**, closing off the legal and ideological space this order was designed to open for authoritarian, racially regressive rule.\n\n\nPairwise evaluation payload placeholder."
