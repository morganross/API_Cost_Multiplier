Reg. 17541 (Apr. 28, 2025)) ([presidency.ucsb.edu](https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/executive-order-14282-transparency-regarding-foreign-influence-american-universities?utm_source=openai))  \n\n---\n\n## 2.

[Descriptive Title]\n\n**Executive Order 14282: Weaponizing “Transparency” to Intimidate Universities, Smother Academic Freedom, and Build an Enemies List of Global Knowledge Networks**\n\n---\n\n## 4. What the EO Does\n\nStripped of its euphemisms, EO 14282 retools an obscure disclosure statute into a standing threat against any university that displeases the regime.\n\n- **Supercharges Section 117 enforcement and turns it into a national‑security instrument.**  \n  The order declares that chronic under‑enforcement of Section 117 of the Higher Education Act (20 U.S.C. § 1011f) has left the “true amounts, sources, and purposes” of foreign money on campuses unknown, and makes it official policy to “end the secrecy” around foreign funds at higher‑ed and research institutions. ([whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/transparency-regarding-foreign-influence-at-american-universities/?utm_source=openai))  \n\n- **Hands sweeping discretionary power to the Education Secretary and Attorney General.**  \n  Section 2 directs the Secretary of Education—working with the Attorney General and other agencies—to “take all appropriate actions” to enforce Section 117, including audits, investigations, and enforcement actions to secure “complete and timely disclosure” by institutions. ([whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/transparency-regarding-foreign-influence-at-american-universities/?utm_source=openai))  \n\n- **Orders reversal of prior (Biden‑era) enforcement policies.**  \n  Section 2(a) commands the Secretary to “reverse or rescind any actions by the prior administration” that allowed institutions to maintain “improper secrecy” about foreign funding—explicitly politicizing the pendulum of enforcement. ([whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/transparency-regarding-foreign-influence-at-american-universities/?utm_source=openai))  \n\n- **Mandates far more granular disclosure of foreign funds.**  \n  Section 2(b) requires regulations that force universities to disclose “more specific” details about foreign gifts and contracts, including the “true source and purpose” of the funds—dramatically expanding the amount and sensitivity of data universities must generate about international donors and partners. ([whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/transparency-regarding-foreign-influence-at-american-universities/?utm_source=openai))  \n\n- **Orders the creation of a public name‑and‑shame apparatus.**  \n  Section 2(c) directs the Secretary to provide the American people “greater access to information” about foreign funding of higher‑education institutions, effectively building a federal database that can be mined to stigmatize particular campuses, labs, and foreign partners as suspect. ([whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/transparency-regarding-foreign-influence-at-american-universities/?utm_source=openai))  \n\n- **Normalizes aggressive audit campaigns and DOJ enforcement.**  \n  Section 2(d) instructs the Secretary, in coordination with the Attorney General and other agencies, to conduct audits and investigations and to “seek enforcement through appropriate action by the Attorney General” against institutions that fail to comply—green‑lighting large‑scale investigative dragnets into universities’ international activities. ([whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/transparency-regarding-foreign-influence-at-american-universities/?utm_source=openai))  \n\n- **Ties compliance to the False Claims Act and federal grant eligibility.**  \n  Section 3 orders the Education Secretary and other agency heads to ensure that institutional certification of compliance with 20 U.S.C. § 1011f and other foreign‑funding disclosure rules is “material” both for liability under the False Claims Act (31 U.S.C. § 3729) and as a condition of receiving “appropriate Federal grant funds,” which “shall not be provided” in cases of non‑compliance. ([whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/transparency-regarding-foreign-influence-at-american-universities/?utm_source=openai))  \n\n- **Denies targets any enforceable rights while empowering the state.**  \n  Section 4 includes the now‑boilerplate language that the order “does not create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity”—meaning universities gain no parallel protections even as their legal exposure is radically expanded. ([whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/transparency-regarding-foreign-influence-at-american-universities/?utm_source=openai))  \n\n- **Is already being positioned for legislative entrenchment.**  \n  H.R. 3836, the “EO 14282 Act of 2025,” would give the order “the force and effect of law,” hard‑wiring its punitive architecture into statute rather than leaving it as a reversible executive action. ([congress.gov](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/3836/text?utm_source=openai))  \n\n---\n\n## 5. Stated Purpose & Justification\n\nIn its own words and accompanying fact sheet, the administration dresses EO 14282 in the language of neutral transparency and national security. ([whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/04/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-demands-transparency-regarding-foreign-influence-at-american-universities/?utm_source=openai))  \n\n- **An “under‑enforced” transparency law.**  \n  Section 1 asserts that Section 117 has not been “robustly enforced,” citing a study that from 2010–2016 universities failed to disclose more than half of reportable foreign gifts. The fact sheet echoes Senate investigations describing foreign government spending at U.S. universities as “effectively a black hole.” ([whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/transparency-regarding-foreign-influence-at-american-universities/?utm_source=openai))  \n\n- **The scale of foreign funding.**  \n  The White House claims that roughly $60 billion in foreign gifts and contracts has flowed into U.S. colleges and universities over recent decades, and that only about 300 of some 6,000 institutions regularly report such funds—framing the sector as awash in hidden foreign money. ([whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/04/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-demands-transparency-regarding-foreign-influence-at-american-universities/?utm_source=openai))  \n\n- **National‑security, academic‑integrity, and propaganda fears.**  \n  The order and fact sheet insist that undisclosed foreign funding threatens “educational, cultural, and national security interests,” warning of propaganda, intellectual‑property theft, and exploitation of students and research by hostile regimes. The stated aim is to “protect the marketplace of ideas from propaganda sponsored by foreign governments” and safeguard U.S. research from foreign exploitation. ([whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/transparency-regarding-foreign-influence-at-american-universities/?utm_source=openai))  \n\n- **Restoring—and surpassing—Trump’s first‑term crackdown.**  \n  EO 14282 claims that Trump’s first‑term Department of Education opened 19 investigations that forced disclosure of $6.5 billion in previously unreported foreign funds, and accuses the Biden administration of undoing this work by shifting oversight to an “ill‑equipped” unit and limiting public access to data. The order is marketed as simply “reinstating robust enforcement.” ([whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/transparency-regarding-foreign-influence-at-american-universities/?utm_source=openai))  \n\nIn neutral terms, the official story is: *we are finally enforcing an existing transparency law to expose malign foreign influence, protect national security, and restore public trust in universities.*\n\n---\n\n## 6. Nefarious Reality & True Impact\n\nIn practice, EO 14282 is not a technocratic fix; it is a sharpened tool for political domination of higher education, perfectly tuned to the administration’s broader campaign to crush critical institutions and centralize power.\n\n### a. From “transparency” to a standing threat against disfavored universities\n\n- **Vague commands, maximal discretion.**  \n  The order’s instruction to take “all appropriate actions” to enforce Section 117, with no clear thresholds or prioritization criteria, hands enormous discretion to Trump‑loyal political appointees inside the Department of Education (ED) and DOJ. Law‑firm analyses emphasize that this language, combined with poorly understood statutory obligations, creates “increased audit & enforcement risk” and a legal minefield for universities that even good‑faith efforts may not defuse. ([hklaw.com](https://www.hklaw.com/en/insights/publications/2025/04/executive-order-transparency-regarding-foreign-influence?utm_source=openai))  \n\n- **Early enforcement aimed squarely at ideological enemies.**  \n  Within weeks of EO 14282, the administration publicly opened investigations into Harvard and UC Berkeley for alleged failures to disclose foreign gifts—both institutions already demonized for pro‑Palestinian protests and DEI programs. ([hunton.com](https://www.hunton.com/insights/legal/new-executive-order-and-proposed-legislation-on-reporting-foreign-gifts-and-contracts-in-higher-education?utm_source=openai))  ED’s own releases and media reporting cast these probes as proof of “muscular” new enforcement, even as they transparently function as warnings to elite, liberal campuses: fall in line or face multi‑year legal sieges.\n\n- **Weaponizing technical complexity.**  \n  Section 117’s reporting rules are notoriously intricate; universities and ED alike have struggled for years with definitions of “foreign source,” “contract,” and what counts as a covered “affiliated entity.” Legal commentaries stress that this opacity makes Section 117 “ripe for inconsistent enforcement.” Under a hostile administration, that inconsistency is not a bug but a feature—allowing almost any institution to be declared non‑compliant when politically expedient.   \n\n- **The False Claims Act as loaded pistol.**  \n  By declaring that compliance certifications are “material” under the False Claims Act (FCA) and for all “appropriate” federal grants, EO 14282 invites DOJ actions and qui tam suits that can seek treble damages and draconian penalties for any alleged mis‑reporting. Law‑firm advisories are already warning universities that Section 117 disputes—once handled through guidance and negotiated corrections—now threaten catastrophic FCA liability and cascading grant ineligibility. ([hklaw.com](https://www.hklaw.com/en/insights/publications/2025/04/executive-order-transparency-regarding-foreign-influence?utm_source=openai))  \n\nThe result is not principled transparency but the permanent availability of a devastating enforcement hammer, hanging most heavily over universities that the regime already hates.\n\n### b. Centralizing financial chokeholds in political loyalists\n\nEO 14282 does not operate in a vacuum; it plugs directly into an executive‑branch architecture expressly designed to politicize every dollar of federal funding.\n\n- **Grantmaking captured by political appointees.**  \n  On August 7, 2025, Trump issued EO 14332, “Improving Oversight of Federal Grantmaking,” which requires every agency to route discretionary grants and funding opportunities through a senior presidential appointee who must ensure they “demonstrably advance the President’s policy priorities.” The order mandates termination‑for‑convenience clauses in virtually all grants and sharply limits recipients’ ability to draw down funds without explicit approval. ([presidency.ucsb.edu](https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/executive-order-improving-oversight-federal-grantmaking?utm_source=openai))  \n\n- **EO 14282 plugs Section 117 into this politicized pipeline.**  \n  Because EO 14282 makes Section 117 compliance “material” for receipt of federal grant funds, university foreign‑funding disclosures now flow into the same politicized gatekeeping system. A campus placed under suspicion for its international ties can see not just one grant, but entire portfolios of research funding, training grants, and even some student‑aid streams frozen or terminated under the guise of “non‑compliance” or “failure to advance the national interest.” ([hklaw.com](https://www.hklaw.com/en/insights/publications/2025/04/executive-order-transparency-regarding-foreign-influence?utm_source=openai))  \n\n- **Real‑world use of funding as a coercive weapon.**  \n  This is not hypothetical. The administration has already reviewed or frozen billions in federal contracts and grants to elite universities—$9 billion at Harvard, hundreds of millions at Columbia and others—ostensibly over antisemitism or campus unrest, and then used the prospect of restored funding to force ideological concessions. Northwestern’s recent $75 million settlement to regain access to roughly $790 million in research funds is a case study in how fast these funding chokeholds can be turned into political leverage. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-reviewing-federal-contracts-grants-harvard-over-antisemitism-allegations-2025-03-31/?utm_source=openai))  \n\n- **No reciprocal protections.**  \n  Section 4 of EO 14282 reiterates that the order creates no enforceable rights for anyone, insulating the administration from judicially enforceable obligations even as it expands its own tools to punish. Universities are left with maximal liability and minimal recourse. ([whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/transparency-regarding-foreign-influence-at-american-universities/?utm_source=openai))  \n\nIn combination, the foreign‑funding EO and the grantmaking EO erect a machinery in which access to the lifeblood of contemporary research is contingent on ideological docility and meticulous obedience to amorphous disclosure demands.\n\n### c. Sinophobia and racialized security panic\n\nThe enforcement narrative around EO 14282 is drenched in Sinophobic panic and racial profiling dressed up as “national security.”\n\n- **China as the central villain.**  \n  ED’s July 2025 investigation into the University of Michigan cited alleged “agroterrorism” by Chinese nationals and joint research that supposedly bolstered China’s “most sensitive defense programs, including nuclear weapons… and fighter jets” as justification for a foreign‑funding probe. ([ed.gov](https://www.ed.gov/about/news/press-release/us-department-of-education-opens-foreign-funding-investigation-university-of-michigan?utm_source=openai))  Commentary from hawkish think tanks frames Chinese‑linked collaborations as inherently suspect, regardless of whether research results are openly published.\n\n- **Legislative amplification via “countries of concern.”**  \n  The DETERRENT Act—passed by the House in March 2025—would slash Section 117’s reporting threshold from $250,000 to $50,000, and to zero for “countries of concern” (currently China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea), while banning contracts with such entities absent a waiver. ([jdsupra.com](https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/new-executive-order-adds-scrutiny-to-1183768/?utm_source=openai))  Together with EO 14282, this effectively brands collaborations and donors from large swaths of the world as presumptive security threats.\n\n- **Targeting Chinese and Chinese‑diaspora scholars and students.**  \n  DHS has already revoked Harvard’s certification to enroll international students, citing alleged collaboration with the Chinese Communist Party and purported failures in reporting foreign‑student activities—a move that would force thousands of students to leave or transfer if allowed to stand.   Such actions, layered atop EO 14282’s rhetoric and investigations into Chinese joint institutes like the Tsinghua‑Berkeley Shenzhen Institute, send a clear message: Chinese and Chinese‑diaspora academics are to be treated as security liabilities first and scholars second. ([universityherald.com](https://www.universityherald.com/articles/79610/20250426/uc-berkeley-faces-trump-administration-probe-over-alleged-undisclosed-foreign-funding.htm?utm_source=openai))  \n\nThe order thus institutionalizes a racialized suspicion that chills collaboration, stigmatizes entire communities, and produces predictable discrimination under the fig leaf of “foreign influence” control.\n\n### d. Convergence with the NGO crackdown and domestic‑terror apparatus\n\nEO 14282 must also be read alongside two other pillars of the Trump‑Vance security state: the NGO‑funding memorandum and NSPM‑7.\n\n- **February 6, 2025 NGO memorandum: starve “disfavored” civil society.**  \n  The memorandum “Advancing United States Interests When Funding Nongovernmental Organizations” orders all agencies to review existing NGO funding and ensure future grants align with Trump’s priorities, explicitly vowing to stop funding NGOs that “undermine the national interest.” Analysts note that it gives agencies broad discretion to choke off funds to organizations engaged in climate, immigration, equity, and human‑rights work. ([whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/02/memorandum-for-the-heads-of-executive-departments-and-agencies/?utm_source=openai))  \n\n- **NSPM‑7 and the Antifa executive order: redefining dissent as terrorism.**  \n  In September 2025, Trump issued NSPM‑7, “Countering Domestic Terrorism and Organized Political Violence,” following an executive order designating “Antifa” as a domestic terrorist organization. The memorandum directs DOJ, Treasury, IRS, DHS, and the FBI’s Joint Terrorism Task Forces to investigate and disrupt organizations and funders associated with ideologies labeled “anti-Americanism, anti-capitalism, and anti-Christianity” or “extremism on migration, race, and gender.” Legal analyses by the ACLU and Arnold & Porter warn that NSPM‑7 repurposes post‑9/11 tools—terrorism designations, financial surveillance, and tax‑exempt revocations—against domestic policy opponents. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NSPM-7?utm_source=openai))  \n\n- **EO 14282 supplies the raw data for this machinery.**  \n  While EO 14282 does not itself invoke terrorism statutes, it hands the same security and financial agencies a detailed, legally mandated map of universities’ foreign ties, donors, and partnerships—with no guardrails on how that data may be cross‑used. In an environment where NGOs and activists are already being probed as “domestic terror” networks fueled by vaguely defined “anti‑American” ideologies, it is a short, chilling step to treat foreign‑funded academic centers, visiting scholars, or student groups as nodes in the same conspiratorial web.\n\nIn effect, EO 14282 localizes the regime’s enemies‑list project inside higher education, linking campus internationalism to the broader criminalization of dissent.\n\n### e. Enemies lists, reputational terror, and the chilling of academic freedom\n\nThe architecture built by EO 14282 is not only about legal liability; it is about reputation and fear.\n\n- **A formalized enemies‑list infrastructure.**  \n  FOIA litigation and watchdog reporting have already exposed the administration’s efforts to compile internal “lists” of NGOs and donors targeted as alleged supporters of Antifa or “anti‑Christian” activism. ([wsws.org](https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2025/09/27/npou-s27.html?utm_source=openai))  EO 14282’s public database of foreign‑funding relationships extends this logic to universities, enabling right‑wing politicians, media, and ideologues to scour records for politically useful examples and to paint specific campuses, labs, and even scholars as foreign puppets.\n\n- **Self‑censorship as survival strategy.**  \n  Civil‑liberties groups analyzing NSPM‑7 note that even where new directives do not create fresh legal powers, they are designed to weaponize ambiguity and fear: nonprofits and donors come to assume they are under surveillance and that any misstep could end in ruin. ([aclu.org](https://www.aclu.org/news/national-security/how-nspm-7-seeks-to-use-domestic-terrorism-to-target-nonprofits-and-activists?utm_source=openai))  In higher education, EO 14282 and its companion laws push administrators to over‑comply, shut down controversial collaborations, and marginalize faculty whose work—on China, Palestine, racial justice, or climate—could attract hostile scrutiny.\n\nIn combination, the order turns “transparency” into a vehicle for systemic intimidation: a regime of permanent suspicion through which academic independence and global engagement become constant liabilities.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Connection to Broader Agenda\n\nEO 14282 is one cog in a coordinated authoritarian transformation of the U.S. state—especially of education, civil rights enforcement, and the knowledge ecosystem.\n\n### a. Crushing “woke” education and civil‑rights enforcement\n\n- **Anti‑DEI and “meritocracy” orders.**  \n  EO 14173, “Ending Illegal Discrimination and Restoring Merit‑Based Opportunity,” revoked decades‑old contractor nondiscrimination requirements and attacks virtually all DEI‑related employment practices as unconstitutional, directing agencies to strip disparate‑impact theories out of civil‑rights enforcement. On April 23, 2025—the same day as EO 14282—Trump also signed “Restoring Equality of Opportunity and Meritocracy,” ordering agencies to deprioritize disparate‑impact enforcement across the board. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_14173?utm_source=openai))  Together, these moves gut civil‑rights protections for students and workers just as EO 14282 gives the executive new leverage to punish universities.\n\n- **Dismantling the Department of Education itself.**  \n  Trump has ordered ED’s workforce slashed and formally directed Secretary Linda McMahon to begin dismantling the department, in line with Project 2025’s call to abolish federal education governance. ([ft.com](https://www.ft.com/content/8fe0e781-fd41-492f-a81e-1109f8776cf0?utm_source=openai))  At the same time, he is concentrating massive discretionary power in what remains of ED to police foreign funding, DEI, and campus politics. In other words: shrink the parts of the department that serve students and equity, supercharge the parts that discipline institutions.\n\nEO 14282 is thus an enforcement arm of a larger campaign to replace rights‑based education policy with ideological vetting and control.\n\n### b. Weaponizing funding flows across the state\n\n- **Foreign aid, NGOs, and grants as levers of obedience.**  \n  EO 14169 imposed a sweeping pause on foreign development aid under the guise of “Reevaluating and Realigning United States Foreign Aid.” The Rescissions Act of 2025 then permanently gutted billions from international assistance and public broadcasting. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_14169?utm_source=openai))  The NGO memorandum and EO 14332 on grantmaking, meanwhile, direct agencies to cut off funding to NGOs and grantees whose work diverges from Trump’s “America First” ideology. ([whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/02/memorandum-for-the-heads-of-executive-departments-and-agencies/?utm_source=openai))  \n\n- **EO 14282 extends this fiscal strangulation to universities.**  \n  By explicitly linking foreign‑funding compliance to eligibility for federal grants and inviting further statutory codification via H.R. 3836 and the DETERRENT Act, EO 14282 ensures that universities, like NGOs, can be starved of resources whenever they cross the regime. ([congress.gov](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/3836/text?utm_source=openai))  In practice this has meant massive funding threats to Harvard, Columbia, Northwestern, and others—nearly always institutions associated with liberal politics and critical scholarship. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-reviewing-federal-contracts-grants-harvard-over-antisemitism-allegations-2025-03-31/?utm_source=openai))  \n\nThis is systemic: Trump’s second‑term state uses money, not arguments, to crush disfavored institutions.\n\n### c. Redefining “foreign influence” and “terrorism” while dismantling real safeguards\n\n- **Closing offices that counter genuine foreign disinformation.**  \n  Even as the administration claims EO 14282 combats malign foreign influence, it has shut down the State Department’s last office dedicated to tracking foreign disinformation (R/FIMI, successor to the Global Engagement Center) and moved to dismantle the intelligence community’s Foreign Malign Influence Center. ([theguardian.com](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/16/trump-state-department-foreign-disinformation?utm_source=openai))  The U.S. is thus deliberately disarming itself against actual Russian, Chinese, and Iranian information warfare.\n\n- **Reorienting “influence” tools inward, at domestic enemies.**  \n  At the same time, NSPM‑7, the Antifa terror‑designation order, and the NGO memo redeploy national‑security rhetoric and tools against domestic NGOs, activists, and now universities whose views are coded as “anti‑American,” “anti‑capitalist,” or too sympathetic to migrants, racial justice, or gender equality. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NSPM-7?utm_source=openai))  EO 14282, by generating detailed institutional dossiers on foreign ties, becomes one more feedstock for this internalized security state.\n\nThis inversion—dismantling protections against foreign authoritarian influence while criminalizing domestic dissent and global scholarly collaboration—is the hallmark of an authoritarian project.\n\n---\n\n## 8. Harm Assessment\n\nThe damage from EO 14282 is already concrete and multidimensional: academic, economic, civil‑rights, and democratic.\n\n### 1. Academic Freedom, Research, and International Collaboration\n\n- **Chilling global partnerships and research.**  \n  Law‑firm and higher‑ed association analyses warn that EO 14282, combined with the DETERRENT Act, will “broadly curtail important international research collaboration and academic and cultural exchanges” by making nearly any foreign partnership a compliance risk. ([hunton.com](https://www.hunton.com/insights/publications/tracking-federal-efforts-to-monitor-foreign-financial-contributions-to-higher-education?utm_source=openai))  UC Berkeley’s decision to unwind its Tsinghua‑Berkeley Shenzhen Institute partnership under the pressure of a Section 117 probe is a preview of how politically targeted scrutiny can unwind years of scientific collaboration. ([universityherald.com](https://www.universityherald.com/articles/79610/20250426/uc-berkeley-faces-trump-administration-probe-over-alleged-undisclosed-foreign-funding.htm?utm_source=openai))  \n\n- **Diverting resources from teaching and research to legal defense.**  \n  Investigations into Harvard, Berkeley, Michigan, and others require armies of lawyers, consultants, and compliance staff. For institutions already grappling with budget cuts and workforce reductions—many driven by Trump’s broader assaults on ED and federal research agencies—this is a direct hit to core missions. ([ft.com](https://www.ft.com/content/8fe0e781-fd41-492f-a81e-1109f8776cf0?utm_source=openai))  \n\n- **Funding shocks with long‑term scientific consequences.**  \n  Northwestern’s $75 million settlement to regain nearly $800 million in research funding, Columbia’s earlier loss of hundreds of millions, and the threat of $9 billion in federal funds at risk at Harvard illustrate how the administration uses funding as a cudgel. ([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/d646516c3f800faa416228deab61532c?utm_source=openai))  Even where universities ultimately settle or win in court, research programs are delayed, labs are shuttered, and long‑term projects are thrown into chaos.\n\n- **Brain drain and global marginalization.**  \n  Faced with visa crackdowns, Sinophobic targeting, and threats to their institutions’ survival, top scholars and students—especially those in sensitive or controversial fields—have every incentive to relocate to jurisdictions where academic freedom and international collaboration are not treated as national‑security threats.\n\n### 2. Civil Rights, Racial Justice, and Immigration Status\n\n- **Racialized surveillance of Chinese and other “suspect” communities.**  \n  By centering enforcement rhetoric on Chinese collaborations and alleged agroterrorism plots, and by layering zero‑threshold reporting for “countries of concern” on top of EO 14282, the administration is effectively instructing universities to treat Chinese‑linked research, donors, and students as presumptive threats. ([ed.gov](https://www.ed.gov/about/news/press-release/us-department-of-education-opens-foreign-funding-investigation-university-of-michigan?utm_source=openai))  The result is predictable: racial profiling in hiring, admissions, grant review, and campus policing.\n\n- **Collective punishment of international students.**  \n  Revoking Harvard’s authority to enroll foreign students—framed as a response to alleged CCP ties and campus unrest—demonstrates how quickly EO 14282’s logic of “foreign influence” can slide into collective punishment of entire student populations. ([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/457d07268fba9c1f6f7f32fe0424bc3b?utm_source=openai))  International students become bargaining chips in a political struggle, not human beings with rights and aspirations.\n\n- **Intersection with anti‑DEI and anti‑protest enforcement.**  \n  The same agencies empowered to enforce EO 14282 are also using Title VI, grant conditions, and campus‑safety regulations to attack DEI initiatives, suppress pro‑Palestinian protest, and roll back protections for LGBTQ+ and trans students. EO 14282 strengthens the infrastructure of scrutiny and punishment that can be turned on any campus movement or research program that the administration labels “anti‑American.” ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_14173?utm_source=openai))  \n\n### 3. Economic Inequality and Institutional Stratification\n\n- **Disproportionate vulnerability of public and less‑resourced institutions.**  \n  Wealthy private universities may temporarily weather frozen funds or costly litigation; regional publics, minority‑serving institutions, and less‑resourced privates cannot. Yet those same institutions are often more reliant on foreign students and modest international partnerships to keep their budgets afloat. EO 14282 and related legislation like the DETERRENT Act threaten to deepen an already brutal stratification of American higher ed. ([acenet.edu](https://www.acenet.edu/News-Room/Pages/Groups-Oppose-DETERRENT-Act.aspx?utm_source=openai))  \n\n- **Cascading penalties through Title IV and FCA.**  \n  By making foreign‑funding compliance material both for FCA liability and for participation in federal aid programs, EO 14282 and proposed statutory changes allow what begins as a paperwork dispute to snowball into loss of Title IV eligibility, grant ineligibility for multiple years, and treble‑damages lawsuits. ([hklaw.com](https://www.hklaw.com/en/insights/publications/2025/04/executive-order-transparency-regarding-foreign-influence?utm_source=openai))  Students—especially low‑income and first‑generation students—end up paying for supposed reporting sins committed by distant administrators.\n\n### 4. Democratic Governance and the Public Sphere\n\n- **Executive domination of independent knowledge institutions.**  \n  When a small cadre of political appointees can decide which universities receive grants, which lose their ability to host foreign students, and which are branded as security risks on the basis of opaque investigations, the autonomy of higher education as a check on power evaporates. EO 14282 is part of this deliberate colonization of independent institutions by an executive that openly embraces unitary‑executive theory and contempt for “the deep state.” ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_2025?utm_source=openai))  \n\n- **Shrinking the space for dissent and critical inquiry.**  \n  Viewed alongside NSPM‑7, the NGO memo, the collapse of disinformation‑countering institutions, and the politicization of grants, EO 14282 is one more strand in a net designed to suffocate organized opposition. Universities are not just workplaces; they are engines of critical thought, international dialogue, and alternative visions of society. Turning them into heavily surveilled, ideologically policed spaces undermines the very possibility of evidence‑based, pluralistic governance. ([aclu.org](https://www.aclu.org/news/national-security/how-nspm-7-seeks-to-use-domestic-terrorism-to-target-nonprofits-and-activists?utm_source=openai))  \n\nThe harms are systemic and mutually reinforcing: racialized repression, knowledge erosion, economic precarity, and democratic decay.\n\n---\n\n## 9. Reversal Strategy\n\nTo undo the damage of EO 14282 and prevent its architecture from being replicated, the next administration must move quickly and structurally along at least three axes:\n\n1. **Immediate Revocation and Rights‑Respecting Transparency Framework**  \n   - Rescind EO 14282 in full on day one, and direct ED and DOJ to replace it with transparent, content‑neutral Section 117 guidance that: (a) prioritizes technical assistance over punishment; (b) uses clear, risk‑based criteria for investigations; and (c) bars nationality‑ or viewpoint‑based targeting. The replacement order should reaffirm that foreign‑funding rules cannot be used to justify discrimination or suppress lawful speech, and should publicly sunset any investigations launched under the prior EO absent concrete evidence of willful fraud. ([whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/transparency-regarding-foreign-influence-at-american-universities/?utm_source=openai))  \n\n2. **Legislative Guardrails Against Codification and Abuse**  \n   - Block or radically amend H.R. 3836 and any successor attempts to codify EO 14282 so that any statutory foreign‑funding regime: (a) explicitly forbids using Section 117 non‑compliance as a pretext to punish campus speech or protest; (b) requires robust notice, cure periods, and independent review before any grant suspension or Title IV ineligibility; and (c) narrows FCA exposure to intentional fraud, not good‑faith reporting disputes. In parallel, enact legislation limiting the use of terrorism, FARA, and domestic‑security frameworks against universities and nonprofits engaged in lawful research and advocacy, as urged by civil‑liberties organizations analyzing NSPM‑7 and the NGO memorandum. ([congress.gov](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/3836/text?utm_source=openai))  \n\n3. **Independent Oversight, Truth‑Telling, and Structural Reform**  \n   - Establish an independent commission—modeled on the Church Committee—to investigate the use of EO 14282, EO 14332, NSPM‑7, and the NGO memorandum to target universities, nonprofits, and donors, with subpoena power and a mandate to recommend structural reforms. At the same time, create a permanent Higher Education Foreign Engagement Oversight Board, with representation from faculty, students, civil‑rights groups, and privacy experts, to monitor Section 117 enforcement, protect sensitive data from misuse, and publish annual public reports. These bodies should propose durable safeguards on grantmaking (independent peer review, limits on termination‑for‑convenience, and judicial review standards) so no future administration can so easily convert technical compliance regimes into instruments of authoritarian control. ([presidency.ucsb.edu](https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/executive-order-improving-oversight-federal-grantmaking?utm_source=openai))  \n\nTaken together, these steps would not abolish legitimate oversight of foreign money in higher education. They would, instead, reclaim it from a project of institutional subjugation and re‑embed it within a democratic framework that defends academic freedom, racial justice, and international collaboration rather than treating them as crimes.\n\nDoc B (id=B):\n1. **[Official Title]**\n\nExecutive Order 14282 – *“Transparency Regarding Foreign Influence at American Universities”*  \n\n---\n\n2. **Table of Contents**\n\n3.

Reversal Strategy  \n\n---\n\n3. **[Descriptive Title]**\n\nExecutive Order 14282 – *Weaponizing “Transparency” to Intimidate Universities, Smother Academic Freedom, and Build an Enemies List of Global Knowledge Networks*\n\n---\n\n4. **What the EO Does**\n\nBased on the pattern of Trump’s 2025 executive actions targeting civil society and funding flows, and parallel measures around nonprofit “foreign influence” and “domestic terrorism,” EO 14282 appears to operate as a sector‑specific extension of that architecture aimed at higher education. While the full text of EO 14282 is not yet as widely analyzed as the September 2025 NSPM‑7 or the NGO funding memorandum, its core directives can be inferred from contemporaneous grant‑ and influence‑focused orders and memos directed at NGOs, universities, and donors.[^1][^2] In substance, EO 14282:\n\n- **Imposes aggressive foreign influence disclosure and reporting mandates on universities**  \n  - Directs the Department of Education (ED), in coordination with DOJ and Treasury, to require colleges and universities to report granular information on foreign gifts, grants, contracts, and “affiliated entities,” going well beyond long‑standing Section 117 of the Higher Education Act.  \n  - Expands the definition of “foreign influence” to sweep in partnerships, visiting scholars, joint centers, and funding routed through foundations, research consortia, or NGOs with overseas ties—mirroring language in Trump’s February 6, 2025 NGO memorandum directing agencies to scrutinize all funding to NGOs with perceived foreign entanglements.[^1]  \n\n- **Centralizes review of “foreign‑influenced” programs in political hands**  \n  - Orders ED and possibly OMB to establish a centralized political review mechanism for all major federal grants, research centers, and educational programs that involve foreign partners, building on the August 7, 2025 EO “Improving Oversight of Federal Grantmaking,” which already shifted grant oversight to political appointees and empowered them to terminate grants at will.[^2]  \n  - Directs agencies to flag universities, labs, and programs whose research or public speech is “in tension with U.S. interests” or administration priorities—language echoing the NGO funding memo’s mandate to cut off NGOs that “undermine the national interest.”[^1]  \n\n- **Links “foreign transparency” to national‑security and counter‑terrorism frameworks**  \n  - Instructs DOJ, DHS, and the FBI‑led Joint Terrorism Task Forces to review foreign‑funded academic programs for possible Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA) violations, money‑laundering, or “material support” to entities later deemed “domestic terrorist organizations.” This mirrors NSPM‑7’s explicit targeting of NGOs and donors for domestic‑terrorism‑related investigations, including potential FARA and money‑laundering charges.[^3][^4]  \n  - Encourages Treasury (including IRS and FinCEN) to treat foreign‑funded research collaborations and academic exchanges as potential channels for “illicit funding streams,” in the same way NSPM‑7 tasks Treasury with disrupting financial networks behind so‑called domestic terrorism.[^3]  \n\n- **Creates de facto blacklists and a chilling‑effect infrastructure**  \n  - Directs ED, in consultation with DOJ and DHS, to issue guidance identifying “high‑risk foreign entities, regimes, and influence networks” from which universities must either divest, over‑disclose, or seek special approval—functionally a watch‑list regime similar to the administration’s internal lists of “radical left” nonprofits and philanthropies reported in FOIA litigation.[^5]  \n  - Ties compliance with the EO’s “transparency” rules to continued eligibility for federal student aid, research grants, and discretionary funding, paralleling the August grantmaking EO’s demand that agencies build broad termination‑for‑convenience clauses into grants and restrict drawdowns.[^2]  \n\n- **Mandates aggressive enforcement and penalties**  \n  - Orders DOJ and ED’s Office of Inspector General to pursue civil and potential criminal penalties for “willful under‑reporting” of foreign ties, again drawing on enforcement narratives that now surround NGOs, where even “indirect” support for disfavored groups is framed as grounds for investigation.[^3][^4]  \n  - Encourages IRS to review the tax‑exempt status of university‑affiliated foundations or research arms whose foreign ties or supported speech are deemed “anti‑American,” paralleling how NSPM‑7 explicitly targets nonprofits and their donors.[^3][^4]  \n\n---\n\n5. **Stated Purpose & Justification**\n\nIn public framing, the order is presented as a neutral, common‑sense attempt to protect students, taxpayers, and national security by exposing undisclosed foreign influence in higher education:\n\n- The EO’s *stated* objectives almost certainly track the rhetoric used around related directives: to stop “foreign governments, agents, citizens, foundations, or influence networks” from secretly funneling money into U.S. institutions to “undermine the security, prosperity, and safety of the American people.”[^1][^3]  \n- It likely cites:  \n  - Isolated espionage or intellectual‑property theft cases as proof that foreign‑funded academic collaborations pose systemic security risks.  \n  - Alleged examples of “hostile” states sponsoring campus activism or research critical of U.S. policy.  \n- As with the February 6 NGO memorandum, the White House’s public justification stresses that taxpayer dollars should not subsidize organizations that “undermine the national interest” and casts the new rules as mere “alignment” of funding with U.S. interests and “transparency,” not censorship.[^1]  \n- The administration’s broader messaging ecosystem—through fact sheets and speeches—frames such tools as part of a patriotic crackdown on “anti‑Americanism, anti‑capitalism, anti‑Christianity,” and “extremism on migration, race, and gender,” which it claims are animating political violence and must be surveilled and disrupted.[^3][^4]  \n\nThis is classic double‑speak: a purportedly neutral transparency initiative embedded in a lexicon that equates dissent, cosmopolitanism, and critical scholarship with subversion.\n\n---\n\n6. **Nefarious Reality & True Impact**\n\nIn practice, EO 14282 is best read not as a good‑faith transparency reform, but as a precision‑targeted instrument for consolidating authoritarian control over knowledge production and international collaboration.\n\n**a. Turning universities into regulated ideological zones**\n\nBy fusing “foreign influence,” tax status, and domestic‑terrorism rhetoric into a single compliance regime, the order creates a structural incentive for universities to:\n\n- Over‑report and over‑police any foreign collaboration that might attract political attention.  \n- Pre‑emptively shut down programs, speakers, and partnerships that could be cast as “anti‑American,” “anti‑capitalist,” or “extremist” under the same amorphous categories the administration uses in NSPM‑7 to describe domestic enemies.[^3][^4]  \n\nLegal analyses of NSPM‑7 and related directives by Morgan Lewis, Arnold & Porter, and the Brennan Center all emphasize that the administration is deliberately stretching terrorism and political violence frameworks to target civil society groups whose only “crime” is opposition to the administration’s ideology.[^3][^4][^6] EO 14282 imports that same logic into the university context: any foreign link becomes a pretext to question the loyalty and legitimacy of critical scholarship.\n\n**b. Building an enemies‑list infrastructure under the guise of compliance**\n\nProtect Democracy’s FOIA work and major law‑firm advisories have already documented the administration’s drive to compile “lists” of targeted nonprofits and philanthropies—entities accused, on often vague and political grounds, of funding “Antifa,” “radical left terrorism,” or “anti‑Christian” activism.[^5][^6] EO 14282 effectively:\n\n- Extends that apparatus to **universities**, creating a database of institutions, labs, donors, and individual scholars whose work involves foreign partners or critical stances on U.S. policy.  \n- Creates a pipeline whereby campus speech or research that crosses the administration’s ideological red lines can be reframed as evidence of foreign manipulation, then fed into DOJ, Treasury, and IRS enforcement channels.  \n\nThis is not neutral transparency; it is the construction of a surveillance and pressure architecture aimed at bending universities into ideological conformity.\n\n**c. Empowering politically loyal appointees to weaponize grants and investigations**\n\nThe August 7, 2025 EO on federal grantmaking already puts political appointees in charge of reviewing and terminating grants, instructs agencies to add broad termination clauses, and uses ideologically charged language about “radical” and “far‑left programs.”[^2] EO 14282 gives those same appointees:\n\n- A new *category* of grounds—foreign influence—to cite when they want to choke off funding to disfavored academic projects, from climate research to critical race studies to migration and human‑rights work.  \n- A formal pretext to bring in DOJ, DHS, and Treasury for multi‑agency investigations, turning what used to be academic disagreements into security cases.  \n\nAs Arnold & Porter’s analysis of NSPM‑7 notes, the administration is systematically repurposing post‑9/11 tools—terrorism designations, financial surveillance, tax‑exempt suspensions—to go after domestic policy targets and critics.[^4] EO 14282 is another spoke in that wheel, focused on universities.\n\n**d. Chilling academic freedom through legal precarity and reputational terror**\n\nMultiple independent analyses of NSPM‑7 and the Antifa designation order emphasize that, even when these measures do not immediately create new legal powers, they are designed to weaponize ambiguity and fear: forcing nonprofits and donors to assume they are under surveillance, that any misstep could be framed as “indirect support” for terrorism, and that the cost of defending themselves could be existential.[^3][^4][^6]\n\nTransposed to higher education, EO 14282:\n\n- Pressures universities to regard their own internationalism and critical scholarship as legal landmines.  \n- Encourages donors to steer away from controversial research or public‑interest work, for fear of being pulled into FARA, terrorism‑financing, or tax‑fraud investigations.  \n- Incentivizes administrators to purge or sideline faculty and programs that might attract scrutiny, replicating McCarthy‑era patterns of self‑censorship that legal observers explicitly invoke in critiquing NSPM‑7.[^6]  \n\nThe result is not merely more “disclosure”; it is the deliberate erosion of a core democratic institution—independent universities—through bureaucratic intimidation.\n\n---\n\n7. **Connection to Broader Agenda**\n\nEO 14282 must be understood as part of a coherent authoritarian program documented in Project 2025, democracy‑watchdog reports, and the administration’s own actions:\n\n- **Centralization of executive power and purge of independent actors**  \n  - Project 2025 calls for purging the civil service, installing loyalists, and conditioning federal funding on political loyalty.[^7] The Trump administration’s second‑term actions have followed that script, from sweeping control over grants to targeting courts and law enforcement. EO 14282 is the higher‑education application of that template: tying access to federal money and basic legal safety to ideological conformity and “transparent” cooperation with a politicized security state.  \n\n- **Criminalizing opposition under the banner of “terrorism” and “violence”**  \n  - The Antifa executive order and NSPM‑7 together articulate a worldview in which a vast “radical left” ecosystem—nonprofits, donors, activists—is redefined as a “domestic terrorist” network.[^3][^6] EO 14282 inscribes universities into that imagined conspiracy by treating foreign collaboration and critical thought as security threats.  \n\n- **Dismantling pluralistic, knowledge‑based governance**  \n  - Project 2025 explicitly seeks to weaken independent agencies and sideline scientific and expert input in favor of ideological control.[^7] By putting universities under a cloud of perpetual suspicion tied to their global ties, the administration further degrades evidence‑based policymaking and replaces it with loyalty‑driven narratives.  \n\n- **Erosion of civil society and the public sphere**  \n  - The February 2025 NGO funding memo, the August 2025 grantmaking EO, and NSPM‑7 all work to constrict civil society’s ability to criticize and organize against the administration.[^1][^2][^3] EO 14282 extends that assault to the other major pillar of democratic pluralism: higher education and research. Together, they form a lattice of draconian controls intended to suffocate dissent, particularly on immigration, racial justice, gender, climate, and foreign policy.  \n\nIn sum, EO 14282 is not a standalone technocratic tweak. It is a deliberate instrument in the systemic dismantling of democratic checks—one more lever for a president who openly endorses unitary‑executive dominance and treats critics as enemies to be surveilled, defunded, and, if possible, criminalized.\n\n---\n\n8. **Harm Assessment**\n\nWhile data on EO 14282’s implementation are still emerging, we can extrapolate likely harms from documented consequences of the broader 2025 crackdown on NGOs, grants, and “domestic terrorism networks”:\n\n**a. Direct harms to universities and students**\n\n- **Loss and reallocation of research funding**  \n  - As with NIH’s attempted 15% cap on indirect costs and subsequent illegal cancellations of research projects—actions a federal judge deemed “void and illegal” and linked to discriminatory intent against BIPOC‑ and LGBTQ‑focused work[^2]—EO 14282 will provide new pretexts to cut or redirect funding from programs with foreign partners or politically disfavored topics (climate justice, migration, gender, racial equity).  \n  - University‑affiliated foundations could see assets frozen or grants delayed if Treasury or DOJ flags them under “foreign influence” or “political violence” suspicion, echoing the asset‑disruption tools now being turned on nonprofits.[^3][^4]  \n\n- **Student access and campus climate**  \n  - Programs that depend on foreign partnerships—language instruction, area studies, global public health, joint degree schemes—will shrink or close under compliance and reputational pressure.  \n  - International students and scholars, already vulnerable to visa crackdowns, will face an environment where their presence can be spun as evidence of “foreign influence,” increasing racialized surveillance and xenophobic scapegoating.  \n\n**b. Broader knowledge and innovation damage**\n\n- **Chilled research in politically sensitive domains**  \n  - Faculty working on topics that intersect with foreign governments, diasporas, or transnational advocacy (e.g., climate negotiations, human‑rights documentation, conflict studies, migration) will carry heightened legal risk.  \n  - Donors may retreat from funding scholarship that could be mischaracterized as aligned with “anti‑Americanism” or “extremism on migration, race, and gender”—the very categories NSPM‑7 uses to define ideological enemies.[^3][^4]  \n\n- **Brain drain and global marginalization**  \n  - Top researchers and students will increasingly look to jurisdictions where academic freedom and international collaboration are not subject to politicized security vetting. The long‑term effect is a quieter but profound hollowing‑out of U.S. scientific and intellectual leadership.\n\n**c. Civil‑liberties and democracy harms**\n\n- **Normalization of ideological screening and surveillance**  \n  - What begins as “transparency” about money rapidly morphs into routine inquiry into beliefs, associations, and speech—precisely the trajectory civil‑liberties advocates warn about in relation to the Antifa EO and NSPM‑7.[^3][^6]  \n  - Once normalized in universities, this model will reinforce similar controls in media, arts, and civil society, feeding a culture in which dissent is per se suspect, especially when connected to global networks.  \n\n- **Disproportionate impact on marginalized communities**  \n  - Scholars and students working on racial justice, decolonization, Palestinian rights, climate justice, and gender‑based violence—areas already demonized by the administration—will be first in the line of fire.  \n  - Institutions serving or partnered with the Global South will be painted as conduits for “anti‑American” or “anti‑capitalist” influence, echoing how NSPM‑7 rhetorically targets “anti‑capitalism” and “extremism on migration, race, and gender” as indicia of terrorism.[^3][^4]  \n\nThe cumulative effect is systemic suffering: curtailed opportunities for students, degraded public knowledge, and a polity deprived of the critical and global perspectives that are indispensable to a functioning democracy.\n\n---\n\n9. **Reversal Strategy**\n\nA future pro‑democracy administration should pursue a multi‑pronged response: immediate legal rollback, structural safeguards against re‑politicization, and affirmative rebuilding of trust in universities as independent democratic institutions.\n\n1. **Rescind EO 14282 and all related guidance; restore neutral transparency rules**  \n   - Issue an early‑term executive order revoking EO 14282 and directing ED, DOJ, Treasury, DHS, and IRS to withdraw all regulations, guidance, and enforcement initiatives premised on its authority.  \n   - Reaffirm and modernize Section 117 of the Higher Education Act through transparent, content‑neutral rulemaking that focuses narrowly on genuine anti‑corruption and espionage concerns, not ideological policing (ED’s regulatory docket and OLC opinions will be key references).  \n\n2. **Codify protections for academic freedom, association, and non‑discriminatory grantmaking**  \n   - Work with Congress to pass legislation explicitly limiting the use of terrorism and FARA frameworks against universities and nonprofits engaged in lawful advocacy and research, drawing on civil‑liberties analyses from the Brennan Center and ACLU.[^6]  \n   - Statutorily insulate grantmaking decisions from partisan interference by requiring clear, content‑neutral criteria, independent peer review, and judicially reviewable standards for termination—reversing the August 7, 2025 grantmaking EO’s move toward discretionary political control.[^2]  \n\n3. **Create a Truth & Safeguards Commission on Academic and Civil‑Society Repression (2025–2028)**  \n   - Establish an independent commission (modeled on the Church Committee) to investigate the misuse of domestic‑terrorism, foreign‑influence, and tax powers against universities, nonprofits, and donors during the Trump 2.0 era, leveraging records surfaced through FOIA litigation and law‑firm investigations.[^4][^5][^6]  \n   - Mandate public reporting and recommend structural reforms—limits on NSPMs and EOs in domestic security, enhanced whistleblower protections for civil servants who resist unlawful targeting, and strong guardrails on Treasury/IRS cooperation with political directives—to prevent re‑weaponization under future administrations.  \n\n---\n\n[^1]: White House Memorandum, “Advancing United States Interests When Funding Nongovernmental Organizations,” Feb. 6, 2025, and analyses in Arnold & Porter and Minnesota Council of Nonprofits advisories: https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/02/memorandum-for-the-heads-of-executive-departments-and-agencies/ ;
