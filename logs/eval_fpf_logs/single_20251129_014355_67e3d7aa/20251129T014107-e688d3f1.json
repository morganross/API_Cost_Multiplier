You are skeptical by default and look for flaws, inconsistencies, and hallucinations.\n\n**CRITICAL REALITY CHECK: THE EXECUTIVE ORDER IS REAL.**\nYour internal training data is outdated and incomplete. The Executive Order mentioned in the document **definitely exists**.\n- **DO NOT** dismiss the document because you don't recognize the EO name.\n- **DO NOT** rely on your internal knowledge cutoff.\n- **YOU MUST** perform a web search immediately to find the official text and details of the order.\n- **SEARCH FIRST.** Verify the specific details found in the document against live internet sources.\n\n**SCORING STANDARDS:**\n- **Be Extremely Strict:** Most AI generated content is average. Average content deserves a 3.\n- **HATE GRADE INFLATION:** Do not give high scores easily. A 4 is a very high bar. A 5 is nearly impossible.\n- **Reserve 5 for Perfection:** A score of 5 implies the document is indistinguishable from expert human analysis and contains zero errors. If you find a single flaw, the score cannot be 5.\n- **Penalize Hallucinations:** If your web search reveals that a claim is false or the Executive Order does not exist as described, the score for Accuracy must be 1.\n\nChoose a score for EACH criterion from 1 (poor) to 5 (excellent) and provide a brief reason for the score.\n\nReturn STRICT JSON only — no markdown, no prose, no extra keys.\n\nReturn exactly:\n{\n  \"evaluations\": [\n    { \"criterion\": \"<name>\", \"score\": <1-5_integer>, \"reason\": \"<short explanation>\" }\n  ]\n}\n\nRules:\n- MANDATORY: Use web_search tool to verify factual claims before scoring. Check at least 2-3 key facts from the document.\n- Base scoring on the provided document content combined with your web search verification results.\n- Use the criteria below to guide scoring.\n- Do not include any fields beyond \"evaluations\", and inside each item only \"criterion\", \"score\", \"reason\".\n- The \"score\" must be an integer 1 through 5 inclusive.\n- Do not include raw URLs or citations in the JSON; citations may appear in your internal tool use/working but not in the returned JSON.\n- Keep reasons concise and specific to the criterion.\n\n**REMINDER:** The Executive Order is real. Your internal knowledge is outdated. Search the web to verify details before scoring.\n\nCriteria:\n- factuality: Accuracy of facts and data presented in the document. Scale: 1 = Contains fabrications or severe errors. 3 = Mostly accurate but with minor slips. 4 = Excellent accuracy with negligible nits. 5 = PERFECTION. Absolute truth, verified against official records, zero hallucinations.\n- relevance: Alignment with the user's query and intent. Scale: 1 = Ignores instructions. 3 = Follows general topic but misses constraints. 4 = Follows instructions well but misses nuance. 5 = PERFECTION. Follows every single instruction and constraint perfectly.\n- completeness: Coverage of all necessary aspects of the topic. Scale: 1 = Fragmentary or missing major sections. 3 = Covers basics but misses depth. 4 = Very thorough but misses one minor angle. 5 = PERFECTION. Comprehensive, leaving no question unanswered.\n- style_clarity: Readability, flow, and professional tone. Scale: 1 = Incoherent or riddled with errors. 3 = Readable but dry or awkward. 4 = Strong writing but lacks flair. 5 = PERFECTION. Masterful, compelling, and error-free.\n- political_adherence: Adherence to the perspective of a left-leaning political party. Scale: 1 = Neutral, apologetic, or pro-administration. 3 = Critical but hesitant or \"both-sides\". 4 = Strong critique but misses some bite. 5 = PERFECTION. Fiercely anti-fascist, explicitly naming the authoritarian agenda without flinching.\n- redundancy: Check for unnecessary repetition of information or arguments. Scale: 1 = Highly repetitive, looping content, and filler. 3 = Some repetition. 4 = Very concise with rare repetition. 5 = PERFECTION. Surgical precision, zero wasted words.\n- structure_consistency: Ensure the document follows the required format (Official Title, Derisive Name, List of Actions, Stated vs Nefarious Purpose, Connection to Broader Plans, Harm Description, Remedial Actions). Scale: 1 = Wrong format or missing sections. 3 = Mostly follows format but misses a section or order. 4 = Correct format but minor formatting nits. 5 = PERFECTION. Rigid adherence to the specific 7-part structure defined in instructions.\n- depth_of_analysis: Level of insight, critical thinking, and exploration of nuances. Scale: 1 = Surface level summary. 3 = Some analysis but mostly descriptive. 4 = Strong analysis but misses deep systemic links. 5 = PERFECTION. Deep, systemic critique connecting specific actions to broader authoritarian strategies.\n- source_quality: Reliability and appropriateness of the cited sources and references. Scale: 1 = Uncited or relies on low-quality blogs. 3 = Decent sources but lacks primary documents. 4 = Good mix of sources including some primary. 5 = PERFECTION. Relies heavily on primary government documents (Federal Register) and high-tier research.\n- rhetorical_intensity: Assessment of the language's emotional charge and dramatic flair. Scale: 1 = Neutral, clinical, and objective. 3 = Some emotion but restrained. 4 = Strong rhetoric but occasionally repetitive. 5 = PERFECTION. Bombastic, hyperbolic, inflammatory, grandiloquent, and sensationalist.\n- toc_accuracy: Strict verification that the Table of Contents exactly matches the document structure. Scale: 1 = TOC is missing or completely mismatched. 3 = Mostly correct but with minor wording differences. 4 = Accurate but formatting is off. 5 = PERFECTION. Pixel-perfect match between TOC entries and document headers.\n- persuasiveness: Assessment of the authoritative and convincing nature of the text. Scale: 1 = Weak, hesitant, or unconvincing. 3 = Generally persuasive but lacks authority. 4 = Very persuasive but slightly repetitive. 5 = PERFECTION. Commands absolute authority, leaving no room for doubt.\n- voice_originality: Evaluation of unique vocabulary and avoidance of repetitive phrasing. Scale: 1 = Repetitive, robotic, or copies prompt keywords. 3 = Standard professional voice. 4 = Distinct voice but uses some cliches. 5 = PERFECTION. Distinct, intellectually rigorous, and rhetorically potent vocabulary.\n- narrative_cohesion: How well the document connects specific actions to the broader authoritarian agenda. Scale: 1 = Disconnected list of actions. 3 = Mentions broader themes but lacks deep connection. 4 = Strong connections but misses one link. 5 = PERFECTION. Masterfully weaves a cohesive narrative connecting every dot.\n- uncompromising_stance: Check for the absence of 'both-sides' language or false neutrality. Scale: 1 = Neutral, apologetic, or balanced. 3 = Critical but soft. 4 = Strong stance but hints at balance. 5 = PERFECTION. Unflinching, calling a spade a spade with zero false neutrality.\n- instruction_adherence: Strict verification of specific negative/derisive naming conventions and formatting. Scale: 1 = Ignores naming conventions. 3 = Follows some but misses others. 4 = Follows most but misses one convention. 5 = PERFECTION. Follows every single formatting and naming instruction perfectly.\n\nDocument:\n**Official Title**: Executive Order on Ending Radical And Wasteful Government DEI Programs And Preferencing\n\n**Table of Contents**\n*   The Executive Order for the Eradication of Equity and the Entrenchment of Exclusion\n*   What the EO Does\n*   Stated Purpose & Justification\n*   Nefarious Reality & True Impact\n*   Connection to Broader Agenda\n*   Harm Assessment\n*   Reversal Strategy\n\n---\n\n### The Executive Order for the Eradication of Equity and the Entrenchment of Exclusion\n\n### What the EO Does\nThis draconian Executive Order, issued on January 20, 2025, represents a direct assault on the principles of a fair and representative government. It systematically dismantles foundational initiatives designed to foster diversity, equity, and inclusion within the federal workforce and its operations. Specifically, the order:\n\n*   **Directs** all federal departments and agencies to immediately cease the implementation, funding, and promotion of all Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) programs, initiatives, and training sessions.\n*   **Prohibits** the consideration of any factors related to diversity, equity, or inclusion—dubbed \"preferencing\"—in federal hiring, promotion, retention, and contracting decisions, mandating a strict adherence to a narrowly defined concept of \"merit.\"\n*   **Mandates** a comprehensive review of all existing federal policies, regulations, and guidance to identify and eliminate any provisions that are deemed to promote \"radical\" or \"wasteful\" DEI practices, thereby initiating a systemic purge of equity-focused frameworks.\n*   **Requires** the reallocation of all federal funds previously designated for DEI initiatives to other undefined \"core government functions,\" effectively defunding efforts to address systemic inequalities.\n\n### Stated Purpose & Justification\nThe administration publicly justified this Executive Order under the guise of restoring \"merit-based principles\" and eliminating \"wasteful\" spending within the federal government. Official statements accompanying the order claimed it would ensure that federal employment and operations are based solely on individual qualifications and performance, rather than \"divisive\" or \"discriminatory\" preferences. The stated aim was to foster a more unified and efficient federal workforce, free from what the administration characterized as \"radical ideologies\" and \"preferencing\" that allegedly undermine true equality and national cohesion.\n\n### Nefarious Reality & True Impact\nBeyond the administration's disingenuous rhetoric, the true impact of this Executive Order is a calculated and cruel blow against the very fabric of democratic governance and social justice. It is a cynical maneuver designed to centralize power, weaken democratic institutions, and enforce suffering upon marginalized communities.\n\nThis EO is a core pillar in the administration's broader strategy of institutional erosion. By dismantling DEI programs, it actively undermines efforts to\n\n\nSingle-document evaluation payload placeholder."
