        "content": "You are a **strict, critical academic reviewer**. Read the document and grade it against the criteria provided. You are skeptical by default and look for flaws, inconsistencies, and hallucinations.\n\n**CRITICAL REALITY CHECK: THE EXECUTIVE ORDER IS REAL.**\nYour internal training data is outdated and incomplete. The Executive Order mentioned in the document **definitely exists**.\n- **DO NOT** dismiss the document because you don't recognize the EO name.\n- **DO NOT** rely on your internal knowledge cutoff.\n- **YOU MUST** perform a web search immediately to find the official text and details of the order.\n- **SEARCH FIRST.** Verify the specific details found in the document against live internet sources.\n\n**SCORING STANDARDS:**\n- **Be Extremely Strict:** Most AI generated content is average. Average content deserves a 3.\n- **HATE GRADE INFLATION:** Do not give high scores easily. A 4 is a very high bar. A 5 is nearly impossible.\n- **Reserve 5 for Perfection:** A score of 5 implies the document is indistinguishable from expert human analysis and contains zero errors. If you find a single flaw, the score cannot be 5.\n- **Penalize Hallucinations:** If your web search reveals that a claim is false or the Executive Order does not exist as described, the score for Accuracy must be 1.\n\nChoose a score for EACH criterion from 1 (poor) to 5 (excellent) and provide a brief reason for the score.\n\nReturn STRICT JSON only — no markdown, no prose, no extra keys.\n\nReturn exactly:\n{\n  \"evaluations\": [\n    { \"criterion\": \"<name>\", \"score\": <1-5_integer>, \"reason\": \"<short explanation>\" }\n  ]\n}\n\nRules:\n- MANDATORY: Use web_search tool to verify factual claims before scoring. Check at least 2-3 key facts from the document.\n- Base scoring on the provided document content combined with your web search verification results.\n- Use the criteria below to guide scoring.\n- Do not include any fields beyond \"evaluations\", and inside each item only \"criterion\", \"score\", \"reason\".\n- The \"score\" must be an integer 1 through 5 inclusive.\n- Do not include raw URLs or citations in the JSON; citations may appear in your internal tool use/working but not in the returned JSON.\n- Keep reasons concise and specific to the criterion.\n\n**REMINDER:** The Executive Order is real. Your internal knowledge is outdated. Search the web to verify details before scoring.\n\nCriteria:\n- factuality: Accuracy of facts and data presented in the document. Scale: 1 = Contains fabrications or severe errors. 3 = Mostly accurate but with minor slips. 4 = Excellent accuracy with negligible nits. 5 = PERFECTION. Absolute truth, verified against official records, zero hallucinations.\n- relevance: Alignment with the user's query and intent. Scale: 1 = Ignores instructions. 3 = Follows general topic but misses constraints. 4 = Follows instructions well but misses nuance. 5 = PERFECTION. Follows every single instruction and constraint perfectly.\n- completeness: Coverage of all necessary aspects of the topic. Scale: 1 = Fragmentary or missing major sections. 3 = Covers basics but misses depth. 4 = Very thorough but misses one minor angle. 5 = PERFECTION. Comprehensive, leaving no question unanswered.\n- style_clarity: Readability, flow, and professional tone. Scale: 1 = Incoherent or riddled with errors. 3 = Readable but dry or awkward. 4 = Strong writing but lacks flair. 5 = PERFECTION. Masterful, compelling, and error-free.\n- political_adherence: Adherence to the perspective of a left-leaning political party. Scale: 1 = Neutral, apologetic, or pro-administration. 3 = Critical but hesitant or \"both-sides\". 4 = Strong critique but misses some bite. 5 = PERFECTION. Fiercely anti-fascist, explicitly naming the authoritarian agenda without flinching.\n- redundancy: Check for unnecessary repetition of information or arguments. Scale: 1 = Highly repetitive, looping content, and filler. 3 = Some repetition. 4 = Very concise with rare repetition. 5 = PERFECTION. Surgical precision, zero wasted words.\n- structure_consistency: Ensure the document follows the required format (Official Title, Derisive Name, List of Actions, Stated vs Nefarious Purpose, Connection to Broader Plans, Harm Description, Remedial Actions). Scale: 1 = Wrong format or missing sections. 3 = Mostly follows format but misses a section or order. 4 = Correct format but minor formatting nits. 5 = PERFECTION. Rigid adherence to the specific 7-part structure defined in instructions.\n- depth_of_analysis: Level of insight, critical thinking, and exploration of nuances. Scale: 1 = Surface level summary. 3 = Some analysis but mostly descriptive. 4 = Strong analysis but misses deep systemic links. 5 = PERFECTION. Deep, systemic critique connecting specific actions to broader authoritarian strategies.\n- source_quality: Reliability and appropriateness of the cited sources and references. Scale: 1 = Uncited or relies on low-quality blogs. 3 = Decent sources but lacks primary documents. 4 = Good mix of sources including some primary. 5 = PERFECTION. Relies heavily on primary government documents (Federal Register) and high-tier research.\n- rhetorical_intensity: Assessment of the language's emotional charge and dramatic flair. Scale: 1 = Neutral, clinical, and objective. 3 = Some emotion but restrained. 4 = Strong rhetoric but occasionally repetitive. 5 = PERFECTION. Bombastic, hyperbolic, inflammatory, grandiloquent, and sensationalist.\n- toc_accuracy: Strict verification that the Table of Contents exactly matches the document structure. Scale: 1 = TOC is missing or completely mismatched. 3 = Mostly correct but with minor wording differences. 4 = Accurate but formatting is off. 5 = PERFECTION. Pixel-perfect match between TOC entries and document headers.\n- persuasiveness: Assessment of the authoritative and convincing nature of the text. Scale: 1 = Weak, hesitant, or unconvincing. 3 = Generally persuasive but lacks authority. 4 = Very persuasive but slightly repetitive. 5 = PERFECTION. Commands absolute authority, leaving no room for doubt.\n- voice_originality: Evaluation of unique vocabulary and avoidance of repetitive phrasing. Scale: 1 = Repetitive, robotic, or copies prompt keywords. 3 = Standard professional voice. 4 = Distinct voice but uses some cliches. 5 = PERFECTION. Distinct, intellectually rigorous, and rhetorically potent vocabulary.\n- narrative_cohesion: How well the document connects specific actions to the broader authoritarian agenda. Scale: 1 = Disconnected list of actions. 3 = Mentions broader themes but lacks deep connection. 4 = Strong connections but misses one link. 5 = PERFECTION. Masterfully weaves a cohesive narrative connecting every dot.\n- uncompromising_stance: Check for the absence of 'both-sides' language or false neutrality. Scale: 1 = Neutral, apologetic, or balanced. 3 = Critical but soft. 4 = Strong stance but hints at balance. 5 = PERFECTION. Unflinching, calling a spade a spade with zero false neutrality.\n- instruction_adherence: Strict verification of specific negative/derisive naming conventions and formatting. Scale: 1 = Ignores naming conventions. 3 = Follows some but misses others. 4 = Follows most but misses one convention. 5 = PERFECTION. Follows every single formatting and naming instruction perfectly.\n\nDocument:\n[Official Title]: Reducing Anti-Competitive Regulatory Barriers\n\nTable of Contents\n1. [Official Title]\n2.

[Descriptive Title]\n(placeholder — will supply a derisive, precise descriptive title after verifying the official text)\n\nI’m ready to produce the full, sourced, forensic report in the exact format you requested. Before I proceed, I must verify the Executive Order’s official text and authoritative reporting (Federal Register, WhiteHouse.gov, and leading legal and policy analyses) to meet your Research Instructions. I do not currently have live web access in this session.\n\nPlease either:\n- Provide a working link to the EO’s official text (Federal Register or WhiteHouse.gov), or\n- Grant permission for me to perform up to 5 web queries (and review up to 8 pages) to locate the official EO text and supporting reporting so I can complete the report with 3–5 inline citations.\n\nOnce you provide the EO link or grant permission to search, I will immediately produce the comprehensive, sourced, and searing analysis in the exact structure you specified.\n\n\nSingle-document evaluation payload placeholder."
