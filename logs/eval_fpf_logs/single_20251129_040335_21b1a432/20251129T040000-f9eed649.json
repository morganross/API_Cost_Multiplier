Reversal Strategy\n\n***\n\n## The Twin Pillars of Authoritarian Deconstruction: Politicizing the Civil Service and Deregulating for Plutocracy\n\nThe current administration, under Donald Trump's second term, has unleashed a calculated and unprecedented assault on the foundational pillars of American governance and public welfare through a series of draconian executive actions. Foremost among these are Executive Order 14171, \"Restoring Accountability to Policy-Influencing Positions Within the Federal Workforce,\" and Executive Order 14267, \"Reducing Anti-Competitive Regulatory Barriers.\" These twin directives, deceptively titled to mask their true, malevolent intent, represent a systemic dismantling of the nonpartisan civil service and a brazen nullification of critical regulatory frameworks. Together, they form a calculated blueprint for authoritarian control, enabling the wholesale politicization of federal expertise and the unchecked empowerment of corporate avarice, thereby entrenching plutocratic control over the nation's institutions and unleashing systemic suffering upon its populace. This is not merely bureaucratic adjustment; it is an overt act of institutional erosion, paving the way for an executive branch beholden only to its own will and the narrow interests it serves.\n\n## What the Executive Orders Do\n\nThese executive orders represent a brazen and calculated assault on the foundational principles of the American civil service and the regulatory frameworks designed to protect the public interest.\n\n**Executive Order 14171: \"Restoring Accountability to Policy-Influencing Positions Within the Federal Workforce\"**\n\nSigned on January 20, 2025, this order is a direct and aggressive reinstatement and significant amendment of Executive Order 13957, which previously sought to create \"Schedule F.\" Rebranded as \"Schedule Policy/Career,\" EO 14171 mandates its pervasive implementation across federal agencies.\n\nThe core directives of this Executive Order are as follows:\n\n*   **Reinstatement and Amendment of Schedule F**: The order revives the controversial Schedule F mechanism, rebranding it as \"Schedule Policy/Career,\" and mandates its implementation across federal agencies.\n*   **Reclassification of \"Policy-Influencing\" Positions**: Agency leaders are compelled to identify and reassign career federal employees in competitive service positions or other excepted service roles that are deemed to influence policy.\n*   **Erosion of Civil Service Protections**: Employees whose positions are reclassified into Schedule Policy/Career are stripped of long-standing civil service protections, including due process rights, safeguards against arbitrary or politically motivated firing, and appeal rights to the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB).\n*   **Creation of \"At-Will\" Employment**: These reclassified positions become \"at-will\" employment, allowing for the expedited removal of employees for reasons such as \"poor performance, misconduct, or undermining Presidential directives\".\n*   **Targeting Senior Executive Service (SES) Officials**: An additional executive order permits the removal of career Senior Executive Service (SES) officials for \"inefficient or negligent\" implementation of the President's policy priorities, further extending political control to the highest echelons of the career workforce.\n*   **Office of Personnel Management (OPM) Rulemaking**: The OPM has subsequently proposed a new rule in April 2025 to regulate this Schedule Policy/Career, outlining the process for reclassification and the diminished protections for affected employees.\n\n**Executive Order 14267: \"Reducing Anti-Competitive Regulatory Barriers\"**\n\nThis executive order directs a sweeping federal initiative to systematically identify, weaken, and ultimately eliminate regulations deemed \"anti-competitive\" or \"burdensome\" across all executive departments and agencies.\n\nIts core directives include:\n\n*   **Mandating Regulatory Review and Repeal**: All federal agencies are directed to conduct an immediate and comprehensive review of existing regulations, policies, and guidance documents, with the explicit goal of identifying those that \"impede competition,\" \"stifle innovation,\" or \"impose undue costs\" on businesses. Agencies are then ordered to propose specific actions for their repeal, modification, or non-enforcement.\n*   **Establishing Deregulatory Targets**: Agencies are required to set aggressive annual targets for the reduction of regulatory costs and the elimination of specific regulatory provisions, prioritizing those impacting large industries such as energy, finance, manufacturing, and agriculture.\n*   **Streamlining Permitting and Approval Processes**: Agencies are directed to expedite all federal permitting, licensing, and approval processes for new business ventures and infrastructure projects, particularly those in resource extraction and development, by reducing environmental reviews, public comment periods, and other procedural requirements.\n*   **Empowering Industry-Led Advisory Boards**: New \"Industry Competitiveness Councils\" are established within key agencies, composed primarily of representatives from the industries subject to regulation, tasked with advising agency heads on further deregulatory actions and identifying \"barriers to market entry.\"\n*   **Limiting Future Regulatory Authority**: The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) is instructed to develop new guidelines that significantly raise the threshold for proposing and implementing new federal regulations, requiring more stringent cost-benefit analyses that heavily favor corporate interests over public health, safety, or environmental protection.\n*   **Reducing Enforcement Actions**: Agencies are directed to re-evaluate and scale back enforcement activities, shifting focus from proactive compliance monitoring to a reactive, complaint-driven model, thereby reducing the perceived \"regulatory burden\" on businesses.\n\n## Stated Purpose & Justification\n\nThe administration publicly frames Executive Order 14171 as a necessary measure to \"restore accountability\" and enhance \"effective performance management\" within the federal workforce. Official justifications cite the need to ensure that federal agencies are responsive to the President's policy agenda and to address perceived inefficiencies and a lack of responsiveness from career bureaucrats. This is presented as an effort to streamline government operations and ensure a unified execution of federal law, thereby making the government \"truly accountable to the American people\".\n\nSimilarly, Executive Order 14267 is publicly justified as a vital measure to \"unleash American prosperity,\" \"spur economic growth,\" and \"foster a dynamic competitive marketplace\". Official statements claim that excessive and outdated regulations stifle innovation, burden small businesses, and drive up consumer costs, thereby impeding the nation's economic potential. The order is presented as a necessary step to remove \"red tape\" and create a more agile, efficient, and globally competitive economy, ultimately benefiting American workers and families through job creation and lower prices. The White House asserts that by reducing \"anti-competitive barriers,\" the order will democratize markets and allow new businesses to thrive, challenging established monopolies and fostering genuine competition.\n\n## Nefarious Reality & True Impact\n\nBeyond the veneer of \"accountability,\" \"efficiency,\" and \"economic prosperity,\" the nefarious reality of these Executive Orders is a systemic dismantling of public protections, a brazen centralization of power in the hands of corporate elites, and a calculated advancement of a dictatorial agenda that prioritizes private profit over public welfare.\n\n*   **Centralization of Power and Weakening of Democratic Institutions**:\n    *   **EO 14171**: By converting tens, potentially hundreds, of thousands of career positions into at-will employment, EO 14171 fundamentally shifts the balance of power. It allows for the wholesale replacement of experienced professionals with political loyalists, eroding the institutional memory and expertise critical for effective governance. This undermines the very concept of a nonpartisan civil service, a vital check on executive overreach, and ensures continuity of government functions regardless of political transitions. The ability to fire employees for \"undermining Presidential directives\" is a thinly veiled mechanism to silence dissent and enforce ideological conformity, thereby subjugating the bureaucracy to the President's personal will.\n    *   **EO 14267**: This executive order represents a profound institutional erosion, effectively gutting the independent regulatory capacity of the federal government. By mandating aggressive deregulation and empowering industry-led councils, the administration systematically transfers decision-making authority from public servants accountable to the citizenry to unelected corporate lobbyists. This process aims to \"dismantle the deep state\" by politicizing and weakening the civil service, ensuring that regulatory bodies serve as instruments of corporate will rather than guardians of the public trust. The explicit reduction in enforcement actions further neuters agencies, rendering them incapable of holding powerful corporations accountable.\n\n*   **Advancement of a Dictatorial Agenda & Enforcement of Suffering**:\n    *   **EO 14171**: This Executive Order is a cornerstone of the administration's broader agenda to \"dismantle the administrative state\" and \"clean out the Deep State,\" as explicitly outlined in Project 2025 and \"Agenda 47\". It provides the President with a potent tool to purge career professionals who might offer objective advice, enforce regulations impartially, or resist unlawful directives. This creates an environment ripe for abuse of power, where government aid, contracts, licenses, and regulatory approvals could become contingent on demonstrating personal fidelity to the President. Such a system is a hallmark of authoritarian regimes, not a functioning democracy.\n    *   **EO 14267**: The \"reduction of anti-competitive regulatory barriers\" is a euphemism for the deliberate removal of safeguards against corporate malfeasance. This order is a calculated step towards an authoritarian economic model where the state actively facilitates corporate exploitation. By expediting permitting and limiting environmental reviews, the administration enforces suffering on communities disproportionately affected by pollution and resource extraction. The weakening of consumer protections allows for predatory practices, while the erosion of labor standards paves the way for increased worker exploitation, all under the guise of \"efficiency.\"\n\n*   **Beneficiaries vs. Public Good**:\n    *   **EO 14171**: The primary beneficiaries of this order are the President and his political appointees, who gain unchecked control over the federal workforce, and ideological groups seeking to reshape government according to their narrow doctrines. This comes at the direct expense of the public good. The American people rely on a competent, nonpartisan civil service for essential services, regulatory enforcement, and expert advice. Replacing merit with loyalty inevitably degrades government performance, jeopardizes public safety, and fosters an environment where corruption can flourish without institutional resistance. Organizations like the National Treasury Employees Union (NTEU) have vehemently opposed this order, recognizing it as a dangerous step backward to a political spoils system that Congress rejected over a century ago.\n    *   **EO 14267**: The primary beneficiaries of EO 14267 are large corporations and wealthy donors whose business models rely on externalizing costs onto the public and the environment. Industries such as fossil fuels, finance, and manufacturing gain immense advantages through reduced compliance costs, faster project approvals, and diminished oversight. Investigative journalism and legal analyses consistently demonstrate that such deregulation leads to increased corporate profits at the direct expense of public health, environmental integrity, and economic equity. The \"public good\" is sacrificed for the narrow interests of a plutocratic class, further entrenching wealth inequality and corporate dominance.\n\n## Connection to Broader Agenda\n\nExecutive Orders 14171 and 14267 are not isolated acts but integral components of the administration's overarching strategy to consolidate power and dismantle the institutional safeguards of American democracy, accelerating the nation's descent into fascism. Both orders are inextricably linked to the Project 2025 blueprint, which explicitly advocates for \"bending or breaking the bureaucracy to the presidential will\" and a radical redefinition of government's role, stripping it of its protective functions and transforming it into a tool for corporate and ideological control.\n\nThese orders work in concert with other draconian measures, such as the \"Ensuring Accountability for All Agencies\" Executive Order (February 18, 2025), which asserts unprecedented direct presidential control over independent regulatory agencies like the SEC, FTC, and FCC. By simultaneously politicizing the career staff and subjugating independent agencies to White House oversight, the administration systematically erodes the checks and balances designed to prevent executive tyranny.\n\nThe cumulative effect of these actions—including efforts to redefine sex, roll back environmental protections, and weaken social safety nets—is the systemic dismantling of the federal government's capacity to serve the public impartially. This is a calculated move towards an authoritarian dictatorship, where the executive branch can unilaterally dictate policy, bypass legislative intent, and enforce suffering upon vulnerable populations without institutional resistance. The erosion of the civil service and the gutting of regulatory protections are direct attacks on the rule of law, paving the way for a government accountable only to the President, rather than the Constitution and the American people. This strategy serves to accelerate environmental degradation, erode safety nets, and enforce systemic suffering by removing the very protections that mitigate harm. Whether it's the poisoning of air and water, the proliferation of unsafe products, or the exploitation of workers, the \"reduction of regulatory barriers\" translates directly into increased risks and diminished quality of life for the vast majority of Americans, particularly marginalized communities.\n\n## Harm Assessment\n\nThe tangible negative consequences of Executive Orders 14171 and 14267 are profound and far-reaching, threatening the very fabric of democratic governance and imposing immense suffering on vulnerable populations.\n\n*   **Loss of Expertise and Institutional Memory**: The ability to summarily dismiss career professionals under EO 14171 leads to a catastrophic loss of specialized knowledge and institutional memory. This directly impairs the government's capacity to address complex challenges, from public health crises to national security threats, and to deliver essential services effectively.\n*   **Degradation of Public Services and Safety**: As expertise is replaced by political loyalty (EO 14171) and as regulatory oversight is eviscerated (EO 14267), the quality and impartiality of public services will inevitably decline. This impacts critical areas such as food safety, environmental protection, consumer product safety, and financial regulation, leaving the public, especially the most vulnerable, exposed to greater risks and exploitation.\n*   **Increased Corruption and Abuse of Power**: With civil servants stripped of protections (EO 14171), the potential for corruption skyrockets. Decisions regarding government contracts, grants, licenses, and regulatory enforcement can be swayed by political considerations rather than merit or public interest, creating a system ripe for cronyism and illicit influence. The reduction of enforcement actions under EO 14267 further enables corporate malfeasance without accountability.\n*   **Chilling Effect on Federal Employees**: The threat of arbitrary dismissal instills a chilling effect, discouraging federal employees from speaking truth to power, reporting misconduct, or upholding legal and ethical standards that conflict with political directives. This undermines whistleblower protections and fosters a culture of fear and obedience over integrity.\n*   **Economic Instability and Inequality**: The politicization of agencies responsible for economic regulation, labor protections, and social safety nets can lead to policies that disproportionately benefit corporations and the wealthy, exacerbating economic inequality and eroding protections for workers and low-income families. EO 14267, by removing safeguards that prevent corporate monopolies and predatory practices, exacerbates this inequality. Large corporations gain an unfair advantage, stifling genuine competition from smaller businesses and consolidating market power, leading to higher prices for consumers, stagnant wages for workers, and reduced economic mobility.\n*   **Undermining the Rule of Law**: By enabling the executive to effectively make policy without Congress and to refuse to enforce existing legislation, these orders fundamentally undermine the separation of powers and the rule of law.\n*   **Harm to Vulnerable Populations**: Communities of color and low-income areas, already disproportionately exposed to industrial pollution, face exacerbated health crises due to relaxed environmental standards and expedited permitting for polluting industries under EO 14267. Increased rates of asthma, cancer, and developmental disorders are directly linked to the rollback of air and water quality regulations.\n*   **Environmental Damage**: The expedited approval of drilling, mining, and industrial projects, coupled with reduced environmental impact assessments under EO 14267, leads to irreversible ecological destruction. Wetlands are destroyed, pristine lands are despoiled, and biodiversity plummets. For example, the revocation of federal waters for offshore wind development in favor of fossil fuel interests, as seen in related actions, directly contributes to climate change and ecosystem collapse.\n*   **Loss of Rights**: The \"streamlining\" of public comment periods and environmental reviews effectively silences citizen voices and diminishes the public's right to participate in decisions that directly affect their communities and health. This represents a fundamental loss of democratic participation and accountability.\n*   **Specific Data and Examples**: OPM estimates that approximately 50,000 positions could be moved into Schedule Policy/Career, while federal employee unions warn that the number could be as high as 500,000. This represents an unprecedented politicization of the federal workforce, far exceeding the approximately 4,000 political appointees traditionally subject to presidential appointment. The impact on retirement benefits for career employees, whose years of service are tied to their job security, also creates significant anxiety and potential financial hardship.\n\n## Reversal Strategy\n\nTo undo the catastrophic damage inflicted by Executive Orders 14171 and 14267 and restore the integrity of the federal civil service and public protections, the next administration must implement a swift and decisive reversal strategy:\n\n1.  **Immediate Executive Action**: On Day One, the incoming President must immediately rescind Executive Order 14171 and Executive Order 14267, along with any related OPM rules and OMB guidelines. Simultaneously, a new Executive Order must be issued that unequivocally reaffirms the merit system principles, due process rights, and nonpartisan nature of the federal civil service, while also reinstating all regulatory frameworks, environmental protections, consumer safeguards, and labor standards that were weakened or eliminated under the previous directives. This action would restore robust environmental review processes and public participation mechanisms. (Authority: 5 U.S.C. § 553, Administrative Procedure Act; 42 U.S.C. § 4321 et seq., National Environmental Policy Act).\n2.  **Robust Legislative Safeguards**: Congress must enact comprehensive legislation to codify civil service protections into law, preventing any future administration from unilaterally reclassifying positions into \"at-will\" categories like Schedule Policy/Career. This legislation should explicitly define \"policy-influencing\" roles narrowly and reinforce the independence of career federal employees from political interference. Concurrently, new legislation must strengthen foundational environmental laws, consumer protection statutes, and labor rights, explicitly prohibiting the arbitrary rollback of regulations and mandating robust agency enforcement capabilities. (Authority: 5 U.S.C. § 553, Administrative Procedure Act; relevant organic statutes for federal agencies; 5 U.S.C. App. 2, Federal Advisory Committee Act).\n3.  **Aggressive Legal Defense and Support & Public Interest Rulemaking**: The Department of Justice, under a new administration, must vigorously defend the constitutionality of the merit-based civil service system in ongoing lawsuits challenging EO 14171 and its implementation. Additionally, the administration should support legal challenges brought by federal employee unions and civil rights organizations to ensure judicial oversight of executive actions that undermine democratic institutions. Concurrently, the administration must direct federal agencies to aggressively re-staff and re-fund their enforcement divisions, prioritizing proactive compliance monitoring and investigations into corporate malfeasance. Industry-led advisory boards must be replaced with genuinely independent \"Public Interest Rulemaking Councils\" composed of scientists, public health experts, consumer advocates, and labor representatives to guide future regulatory development. (Authority: 31 U.S.C. § 1105, Budget and Accounting Procedures Act; various agency-specific organic statutes; 5 U.S.C. App. 2, Federal Advisory Committee Act).\n\n## References\n\n U.S. Department of Defense, Defense Civilian Personnel Advisory Service. \"Executive Orders And Presidential Memorandums.\" *DCPAS*.
