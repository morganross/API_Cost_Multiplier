Reversal Strategy\n\n[Descriptive Title]\n\"The Spoils-and-Plunder Docket: Politicize the Bureaucracy, Liberate Corporate Power.\"  \nA concise label for the paired executive actions: one weaponizes the civil service by converting policy-facing career staff into removable, loyalty‑subject positions; the other strips regulatory defenses that constrain concentrated corporate power. Together they form a coordinated administrative assault designed to centralize authority, enable crony advantage, and institutionalize suffering.\n\nWhat the EO Does\n\nExecutive Order 14171 — Schedule Policy/Career (Restoring Accountability)\n- Reinstates and amends the late‑term Schedule F framework (Executive Order 13957), replacing the label “Schedule F” with “Schedule Policy/Career” and directing immediate implementation steps across the executive branch. The order instructs the Director of OPM to amend civil‑service regulations and directs agencies to identify positions of a “confidential, policy‑determining, policy‑making, or policy‑advocating character” for reclassification. ([federalregister.gov](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/full_text/html/2025/01/31/2025-02095.html))\n- Converts identified policy‑influencing career roles into a new category in which employees “are required to faithfully implement administration policies” and where failure to do so is explicitly stated as grounds for dismissal; the administration’s rollout contemplates removing procedural hurdles that have historically protected merit‑system employees. OPM has proposed rulemaking to implement the Schedule Policy/Career category and the White House documents that OPM estimates roughly 50,000 positions could be moved into that category. ([whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/04/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-creates-new-federal-employee-category-to-enhance-accountability/))\n- Revokes prior protective orders (e.g., EO 14003) and instructs agencies to suspend or rescind rules that impede implementation, and holds specified CFR provisions inoperative until conforming regulatory changes are promulgated. The directive vests agency heads and OPM with aggressive review and reclassification responsibilities. ([federalregister.gov](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/full_text/html/2025/01/31/2025-02095.html))\n\nExecutive Order 14267 — Reducing Anti‑Competitive Regulatory Barriers\n- Commands agency heads, in consultation with the Chairman of the FTC and the Attorney General, to review the entirety of their rulebooks and identify regulations that (for example) create de facto monopolies, block entry, or unnecessarily burden procurement — and to recommend rescissions or modifications within statutory deadlines. The EO requires initial lists within tight timeframes and consolidation of recommended rescissions via OMB/OIRA into the Unified Regulatory Agenda. ([presidency.ucsb.edu](https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/executive-order-14267-reducing-anti-competitive-regulatory-barriers))\n- Directs a formal request‑for‑information and public comment process under the FTC’s leadership and channels recommended regulatory removals into OMB review and the unified deregulation pipeline, embedding deregulatory targets into ordinary rulemaking calendars. The text ties this process into the administration’s broader deregulatory architecture. ([presidency.ucsb.edu](https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/executive-order-14267-reducing-anti-competitive-regulatory-barriers))\n\nStated Purpose & Justification\n- EO 14171 (Administration line): Framed as restoring “accountability” and correcting a bloated, unresponsive bureaucracy that purportedly obstructs elected policy. Officials portray Schedule Policy/Career as a targeted corrective to ensure that policy‑influencing personnel implement lawful presidential directives more reliably, shorten removal timelines for misconduct/poor performance, and restore manager confidence. OPM’s public materials emphasize speed, accountability, and efficiency, and estimate approximately 50,000 positions could be affected. ([whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/04/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-creates-new-federal-employee-category-to-enhance-accountability/))\n- EO 14267 (Administration line): Framed as removing “anti‑competitive” restraints that “predetermine economic winners and losers,” reviving markets for new entrants, and reducing costs and regulatory burdens that allegedly choke American innovation and competitiveness. The order is presented as a surgical regulatory review intended to revive entrepreneurial dynamism. ([presidency.ucsb.edu](https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/executive-order-14267-reducing-anti-competitive-regulatory-barriers))\n\nNefarious Reality & True Impact\nThe public rationales obscure a coherent, coordinated strategy whose immediate and foreseeable effects are consolidation of executive power, acceleration of corporate capture, and the deliberate weakening of neutral public protections.\n\n- Centralization of power & institutional erosion: EO 14171 transforms broad categories of career personnel into conditional instruments of the presidency — removing the insulation that makes impartial administration possible and concentrating discretionary control of personnel in the hands of political appointees and agency managers answerable to the White House. That redesign restructures institutional incentives: compliance and political tractability are rewarded; independent technical judgment is punished. The EO explicitly reinstates prior Schedule F authority and rescinds protective rules, ensuring a legal pathway for large‑scale reclassification. ([federalregister.gov](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/full_text/html/2025/01/31/2025-02095.html))\n- Enforcement of a dictatorial logic through administrative means: By making career policy positions contingent on \"faithful implementation\" and by embedding an aggressive, administratively enforceable definition of who counts as a policy actor, the administration substitutes political fealty for merit. This is not neutral managerial reform; it is an engine to purge dissent and to align the permanent bureaucracy to an executive agenda that seeks fewer institutional brakes on presidential will. The deregulatory EO (14267) complements this by removing regulatory constraints that would otherwise check private actors. Together, the two EOs create a feedback loop: politicized personnel enable deregulatory accelerants; weakened regulations lower barriers for favored corporate actors. ([federalregister.gov](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/full_text/html/2025/01/31/2025-02095.html))\n- Beneficiaries: The immediate winners are political operatives and connected private interests. Reclassification eases placement of loyalists into sensitive posts; deregulation opens procurement, environmental, and market oversight to faster private capture. The architecture of this package systematically channels public resources, permitting decisions, and regulatory discretion toward corporate actors at the expense of public health, labor protections, environmental stewardship, and competition. Independent watchdogs and public‑interest groups have documented the linkage between the Schedule F concept and a targeted Project 2025 policy stream that envisions bending the bureaucracy to partisan ends. ([protectdemocracy.org](https://protectdemocracy.org/work/trumps-schedule-f-plan-explained/?utm_source=openai))\n- Evidence and legal exposure: The administration’s own documents state the intended mechanics (reinstatement/amendments, rule suspensions, timelines), and outside organisations have mapped the doctrine’s vulnerabilities — from constitutional questions to statutory constraints on arbitrary personnel and rulemaking power. The scale and rapidity of implementation create immediate legal and practical risks (litigation, loss of expertise, mission failure). ([federalregister.gov](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/full_text/html/2025/01/31/2025-02095.html))\n\nConnection to Broader Agenda\nThese EOs are not tactical one‑offs; they are structural components of a broader program to hollow neutral administration and to accelerate plutocratic advantage.\n\n- They sit inside a coordinated deregulatory architecture: 14267 expressly feeds rescission candidates into the Unified Regulatory Agenda created under the administration’s deregulatory initiative, tying department reviews to OMB/OIRA and to other EOs that together constitute a sustained program to “de‑construct” the administrative state. That architecture prioritizes legalistic arguments for narrowing agency authority, procedural compression of rulemaking, and the political staffing of agencies to ensure compliance. ([presidency.ucsb.edu](https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/executive-order-14267-reducing-anti-competitive-regulatory-barriers))\n- Projected ideological outcomes: The combined effect is a predictable erosion of governance designed to benefit concentrated wealth and to neutralize bureaucratic resistance: safety nets fray as regulatory protections are dismantled; environmental reviews and enforcement can be compressed or sidelined; consumer, worker, and public‑health safeguards are deprioritized in favor of faster approvals and lower compliance costs for powerful industries. Advocacy groups and analysts have tied the personnel‑reclassification strategy directly to the Project 2025 playbook of bending the bureaucracy to political ends. ([protectdemocracy.org](https://protectdemocracy.org/work/trumps-schedule-f-plan-explained/?utm_source=openai))\n\nHarm Assessment\nTangible harms are immediate, measurable, and asymmetric — they fall hardest on the most vulnerable and on the public interest.\n\n- Loss of institutional expertise and degraded capacity: Reclassification and subsequent churn will drain experienced career staff, producing institutional amnesia across rule‑writing, enforcement, technical advice, and crisis response. The resultant competency gap will harm service delivery across health, safety, and national security domains. (Administration materials and OPM projections show the policy’s scope and implementation plan.) ([whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/04/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-creates-new-federal-employee-category-to-enhance-accountability/))\n- Chilling effect on whistleblowing, scientific integrity, and rule enforcement: Removing protections tilts incentives toward silence and conformity. Employees who once reported misconduct, flagged safety risks, or insisted on sound science will face deterrents that reduce transparency and increase risk. Legal protections for whistleblowers and independent career judgment are undermined by the new “faithful implementation” standard. ([federalregister.gov](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/full_text/html/2025/01/31/2025-02095.html))\n- Environmental and public‑health damage: Systematic deregulatory review and the accelerated removal of environmental and safety regulations — and the procedural compression of review and comment — increase the probability of pollution, habitat destruction, and preventable health harms, disproportionately affecting frontline communities and communities of color that historically bear the brunt of permitting and toxic exposures. EO 14267’s mechanism — reclassification of rules for rescission and fast‑tracking through OMB — makes these outcomes far more likely. ([presidency.ucsb.edu](https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/executive-order-14267-reducing-anti-competitive-regulatory-barriers))\n- Economic inequality and market concentration: By targeting “anti‑competitive” regulations for removal according to executive directives, the order threatens to entrench incumbent advantage where licensure, procurement rules, and regulatory standards currently limit rent‑seeking. The administration’s framework privileges large firms and matrixed industry interests that can exploit deregulation to consolidate market share. ([presidency.ucsb.edu](https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/executive-order-14267-reducing-anti-competitive-regulatory-barriers))\n- Scale and concrete figures: The administration’s own materials estimate roughly 50,000 positions could be moved into Schedule Policy/Career; outside analysts and watchdogs warn the reclassification could be substantially broader if definitions of “policy influence” are applied expansively. The structure — rescind protective rules, add new personnel categories, and require agency reclassification — creates the pathway to mass reassignments and widespread loss of civil‑service safeguards. ([whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/04/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-creates-new-federal-employee-category-to-enhance-accountability/))\n\nReversal Strategy\nThree immediate, legally robust actions the next administration should take to undo the damage — concise, operational, and anchored in statute and rulemaking norms.\n\n1) Day‑One Executive Rescission and Regulatory Stay: On Inauguration‑Day the President should issue a targeted rescission of EO 14171 and EO 14267 and simultaneously instruct OPM and OMB to freeze implementation actions (including any pending agency reclassification orders or rule suspensions) pending full review. Parallelly, the new administration should publish a Federal Register notice invoking administrative pauses where legally permissible to prevent further personnel churn or regulatory dismantling during transition. (Authority and references: text of the EOs themselves and the Executive power to rescind presidential actions; see EO texts for exact implementation pathways.) ([federalregister.gov](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/full_text/html/2025/01/31/2025-02095.html))\n\n2) Restore and Codify Civil‑Service Protections by Rule and Statute: Use OPM rulemaking to restore due‑process, MSPB appeal rights, and the protections rescinded by EO 14171 — promulgating rules under the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. § 553) with full notice‑and‑comment — and push Congress to codify fundamental merit‑system safeguards (amend 5 U.S.C. chapters governing appointment, adverse actions, and appeal rights) so that simple executive fiat cannot re‑create Schedule‑style categories. (Authority: Administrative Procedure Act; see 5 U.S.C. § 553 for rulemaking requirements.) ([law.cornell.edu](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/553?utm_source=openai))\n\n3) Rebuild Regulatory Defenses & Procedural Bulwarks: Immediately instruct CEQ/agency counsel and OMB/OIRA to restore prior NEPA and enforcement timelines and to reverse any shortcuts created to compress environmental or public‑comment processes; re‑prioritize enforcement capacity and fund restoration of inspectorates and enforcement divisions. Concurrently establish Public‑Interest Rulemaking Councils (using the Federal Advisory Committee Act framework) to ensure future regulatory reviews center independent scientists, labor and consumer advocates, and public‑health experts — not industry capture. Use statutory levers (NEPA, APA, agency organic statutes) to challenge and reverse unlawful rescissions where necessary. ([law.cornell.edu](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/553?utm_source=openai))\n\nFinal charge (tone for implementation)\nThese actions are not mere housekeeping. They are urgent democratic triage. Rescinding the EOs, restoring statutory and regulatory protections, and rebuilding enforcement are necessary to halt a coordinated attempt to convert the federal apparatus from a public‑serving instrument into a vehicle for partisan control and corporate advantage. The next administration must act quickly, legally, and visibly — restoring the merit system, reinvesting in public institutions, and re‑anchoring regulation in evidence and public interest rather than in plutocratic entrenchment and administrative capture.
