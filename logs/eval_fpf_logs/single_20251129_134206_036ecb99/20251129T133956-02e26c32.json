Report A details an EO titled \"Designating Cartels And Other Organizations As Foreign Terrorist Organizations And Specially Designated Global Terrorists,\" while Report B addresses \"Executive Order 14268 — Reforming Foreign Defense Sales to Improve Speed and Accountability.\"\n\nTo resolve this irreconcilable discrepancy and fulfill the user's explicit instruction to \"create a single, superior 'Gold Standard' report by combining the best elements of both,\" a decision had to be made regarding which Executive Order to analyze. Since both EOs are presented as \"real\" within the hypothetical political context (Trump's second term, inaugurated January 2025), and given the directive to be comprehensive and exhaustive, it is not possible to synthesize content that describes two fundamentally different sets of directives as if they originate from a single order.\n\nGiven the strong rhetorical intensity and focus on democratic institutions, civil liberties, and authoritarian overreach in Report A, combined with the more specific, detailed directives outlined within that report, it was chosen as the primary subject for the \"Gold Standard\" report. Report B, while well-structured, describes a different policy area. The instructions \"Do not omit any topics found in the reports\" and \"The report must be comprehensive and exhaustive\" also create a tension when combining reports on distinct subjects. Since the core instructions emphasize documenting \"the actions of the administration—which we view as evil and damaging—to prepare for undoing them after the next election,\" Report A's focus on expanding executive power and suppressing dissent aligns more directly with the overarching political objective of the report.\n\nTherefore, this \"Gold Standard\" report focuses exclusively on the Executive Order discussed in Report A, synthesizing its content, enhancing its rhetorical intensity, and ensuring all original structural and stylistic requirements are met, while acknowledging the inherent limitation of not being able to merge two disparate topics into a single coherent report about *one* Executive Order. No information from Report B has been incorporated, as it pertains to a different and distinct Executive Order.\n\n***\n\n# Designating Cartels And Other Organizations As Foreign Terrorist Organizations And Specially Designated Global Terrorists\n\n## Table of Contents\n*   The Authoritarian Expansion of Terror Designations\n*   What the EO Does\n*   Stated Purpose & Justification\n*   Nefarious Reality & True Impact\n*   Connection to Broader Agenda\n*   Harm Assessment\n*   Reversal Strategy\n\n## The Authoritarian Expansion of Terror Designations\n\n## What the EO Does\nExecutive Order (EO) titled \"Designating Cartels And Other Organizations As Foreign Terrorist Organizations And Specially Designated Global Terrorists,\" issued on January 20, 2025, establishes a sweeping and insidious framework for the executive branch to unilaterally label various entities as Foreign Terrorist Organizations (FTOs) or Specially Designated Global Terrorists (SDGTs). Specifically, this draconian order:\n\n*   **Directs the Secretary of State**, in consultation with the Secretaries of the Treasury and Homeland Security, the Attorney General, and the Director of National Intelligence, to recommend designations of \"international cartels\" and \"other organizations\" as FTOs or SDGTs within a mere 14 days of the order's issuance.\n*   **Expands the definition of national security threats** to encompass \"international cartels\" that allegedly exhibit \"convergence between themselves and a range of extra-hemispheric actors, from designated foreign-terror organizations to antagonistic foreign governments,\" and operate as \"complex adaptive systems, characteristic of entities engaged in insurgency and asymmetric warfare.\" This alarmingly vague language significantly broadens the scope of potential targets.\n*   **Mandates a policy of \"total elimination\"** of these designated organizations' presence in the United States and their capacity to threaten U.S. territory, safety, and security through \"extraterritorial command-and-control structures.\" This directive suggests an aggressive, expansive, and potentially militarized approach without clear oversight.\n*   **Leverages existing authorities** under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), and Executive Order 13224 to implement these designations, granting the administration immense, unchecked power to freeze assets, impose sanctions, and restrict travel.\n\n## Stated Purpose & Justification\nThe administration publicly justifies this Executive Order as a critical, necessary measure to protect American national security and territorial integrity from what it describes as the evolving threats posed by international cartels. It asserts that these organizations have transcended traditional organized crime, engaging in activities akin to insurgency and asymmetric warfare, and purportedly collaborating with foreign adversaries. The stated purpose is to ensure the \"total elimination\" of their ability to threaten the United States, thereby safeguarding the American people.\n\n## Nefarious Reality & True Impact\nBeyond the administration's disingenuous rhetoric, the \"Designating Cartels And Other Organizations As Foreign Terrorist Organizations And Specially Designated Global Terrorists\" EO represents a chilling expansion of executive power, a systemic dismantling of due process, and a calculated advancement of a dictatorial agenda. This order is not merely about combating drug trafficking; it is a thinly veiled instrument for the subjugation of dissent and the institutional erosion of civil liberties, paving the way for plutocratic entrenchment and authoritarian control.\n\nThe EO's deliberately vague and expansive language, particularly the inclusion of \"other organizations\" alongside \"cartels,\" grants the executive branch unchecked authority to label any group it deems politically inconvenient as a \"terrorist organization.\" This radical centralization of power allows the administration to bypass traditional legal frameworks, weaponizing national security designations against a broad spectrum of entities, from legitimate political opposition groups to humanitarian organizations. The true beneficiaries are not the American people, but the ideological extremists and forces seeking to silence dissent and consolidate authoritarian rule.\n\nInvestigative journalism has already revealed the insidious trajectory of this policy. In February 2025, the State Department designated eight cartels as FTOs and SDGTs, including Tren de Aragua and MS-13, under this new framework. More alarmingly, the administration has already begun to apply these designations to non-state actors far removed from traditional definitions of terrorism. In November 2025, the administration designated several European \"antifa\" groups as \"specially designated global terrorists,\" further demonstrating the elastic, politically motivated, and utterly dangerous application of this EO. This sets a profoundly perilous precedent, allowing the administration to unilaterally declare any group it opposes, including domestic protest movements, as a national security threat, thereby justifying surveillance, asset forfeiture, and even military action without meaningful congressional oversight or judicial review. Congressional leaders have already raised alarms, demanding transparency regarding the specific organizations designated and the criteria used, highlighting grave concerns about the use of military strikes against these newly defined \"terrorist organizations.\"\n\n## Connection to Broader Agenda\nThis Executive Order is a foundational pillar in the administration's overarching strategy of rising fascism and authoritarian dictatorship. By expanding the definition of \"terrorism\" to encompass a vast and ill-defined array of \"other organizations,\" the administration is constructing a legal architecture for the systematic suppression of any perceived opposition. This mirrors historical patterns of authoritarian regimes that criminalize dissent by labeling political adversaries as existential threats, thus providing a pretext for their subjugation.\n\nThis EO works in concert with other draconian measures enacted by this administration, such as the \"Restoring Accountability For Career Senior Executives\" EO, which ruthlessly undermines the independent civil service, and the \"Ending the Weaponization of the Federal Government\" EO, which purges federal agencies of perceived political enemies. The cumulative effect is the relentless erosion of democratic institutions, the systematic weakening of checks and balances, and the consolidation of unchecked executive power. This is not merely policy; it is a calculated and deliberate assault on the very foundations of a free society, paving the way for systemic suffering by diverting resources from social safety nets, accelerating environmental degradation through deregulation, and enforcing a singular, oppressive ideological vision.\n\n## Harm Assessment\nThe tangible negative consequences of this EO are already manifesting and threaten to deepen the suffering of vulnerable populations, exacerbate economic inequality, and fundamentally dismantle civil liberties, cementing an era of institutional erosion and state-sponsored cruelty.\n\n*   **Suppression of Dissent and Civil Liberties:** The expansive and deliberately ambiguous nature of \"other organizations\" creates a chilling effect on legitimate protest and advocacy. Any group challenging the administration's agenda, from environmental activists to civil rights organizations, could be arbitrarily designated, leading to asset freezes, travel bans, and severe legal repercussions for members and supporters. This effectively criminalizes political opposition, stifling the fundamental rights of free speech and assembly.\n*   **Weaponization of National Security Tools:** The EO transforms powerful counter-terrorism tools, originally designed for genuine and imminent threats, into instruments of political persecution. This not only dilutes the efficacy of these tools against actual terrorist organizations but simultaneously subjects innocent individuals and legitimate organizations to the severe, life-altering penalties associated with terrorism designations.\n*   **Erosion of Due Process and Rule of Law:** Designations under this EO can occur with minimal transparency and severely limited avenues for challenge, effectively denying targeted organizations and individuals their fundamental rights to due process. This systematically undermines the rule of law and establishes a dangerous precedent for executive overreach without judicial or legislative accountability.\n*   **International Isolation and Instability:** The unilateral and politically motivated designation of groups as \"terrorist organizations\" risks alienating international allies, undermining legitimate global counter-terrorism efforts, and potentially provoking retaliatory actions. The politically charged designation of European \"antifa\" groups, for instance, strains diplomatic relations and broadens the scope of potential conflict, destabilizing international cooperation.\n\n## Reversal Strategy\nTo undo the profound damage inflicted by this authoritarian Executive Order, the next administration must undertake immediate, decisive, and comprehensive actions:\n\n1.  **Rescind and Replace with Narrowly Tailored Legislation:** Immediately rescind the \"Designating Cartels And Other Organizations As Foreign Terrorist Organizations And Specially Designated Global Terrorists\" EO. Concurrently, work with Congress to develop and enact narrowly tailored legislation that addresses genuine transnational criminal threats without granting the executive branch unchecked, dictatorial power to label political opponents as terrorists.\n2.  **Establish Independent Review and Oversight:** Institute an independent, bipartisan commission, explicitly insulated from political pressure, to rigorously review all designations made under the rescinded EO. This body must provide clear, accessible pathways for due process, de-listing, and redress for unjustly targeted individuals and organizations, reporting directly to Congress to ensure accountability.\n3.  **Reaffirm Constitutional Protections:** Issue a new Executive Order explicitly reaffirming the constitutional rights to free speech, assembly, and due process. This order must establish strict, unambiguous guidelines that prevent the use of national security designations to target domestic political dissent or legitimate advocacy, thereby restoring critical checks on executive power.\n\n## References\n1.
