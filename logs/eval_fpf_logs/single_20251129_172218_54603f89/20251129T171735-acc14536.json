Harm Assessment\n9. Reversal Strategy\n\n[Descriptive Title]\n“Regulatory Starvation for Profit: The Zero‑Base Strike to Gut Environmental Safeguards and Hand Big Energy the Keys”\n\n4. What the EO Does\n- Directs the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to implement a “zero‑based regulatory budget” for all executive agencies: agencies must count existing regulations as part of a baseline that can be reduced to make room for any new regulatory costs, effectively forcing agencies to eliminate rules before issuing new ones.[1][2]\n- Requires agencies to quantify the annualized regulatory cost of every existing major and many non‑major rules and produce offset plans showing which rules will be rescinded or weakened to permit any new regulatory activity.[1][2]\n- Mandates OMB authority to set agency‑level regulatory cost caps and to certify agency regulatory plans before any rulemaking can proceed; OMB becomes the gatekeeper that approves which rules live or die.[1][2]\n- Orders expedited review and prioritization of energy‑sector regulations — specifically instructs Interior, Energy, EPA, DOI bureaus, and DOT to identify “barriers to domestic energy production” and to recommend immediate eliminations/consolidations of regulatory functions that impede fossil‑fuel development.[1]\n- Directs agencies to submit implementation plans, statutory‑change recommendations, and staffing reorganizations within tight deadlines (30–240 day timelines), creating a rapid statutory review trigger for reorganization and consolidation of agency subcomponents.[1]\n- Imposes hiring and workforce ratio guidelines tied to “efficiency” goals (limits on replacement hiring; expanded OPM/OMB authority to grant or revoke exemptions), facilitating shrinkage of career staff.[1]\n- Creates a short review cadence (e.g., a 240‑day implementation report requirement) and a standing mechanism to extend, modify, or make permanent the zero‑based budgeting regime via administrative recommendations to the President.[1]\n\nSources: official EO text and Federal Register publication of the order.[1][2]\n\n5. Stated Purpose & Justification\n- The White House frames EO 14270 as a housekeeping, efficiency measure to “restore accountability,” eliminate “waste, bloat, and insularity,” and “unleash American energy” by removing outdated or duplicative rules that allegedly hamper jobs and energy independence.[1]\n- It is presented as a technocratic mechanism: requiring agencies to inventory statutes and regulations, to consolidate duplicative entities, and to identify low‑value rules for elimination so that government functions “better serve American families, workers, and taxpayers.”[1]\n- The Administration asserts that centralizing regulatory cost accounting at OMB will bring “discipline” and fiscal responsibility to rulemaking, making agencies justify every new regulatory burden against an explicit budget.[1]\n\nOfficial public text and White House statement: see Executive Order and implementing guidance.[1][2]\n\n6. Nefarious Reality & True Impact\nCentralization of power and weakening of democratic institutions\n- EO 14270 converts OMB from a budgetary reviewer into a permanent choke point over agency rulemaking. By requiring OMB to certify offsets and set caps, the order places quasi‑legislative power into an unelected office, bypassing Congress’s role to set substantive policy and undermining agency independence that Congress established by statute.[1][2]\n- The rapid statutory‑review and consolidation timelines pressure agency leaders to recommend statutory repeals or reorganizations, shifting political fights from Congress into rushed executive processes where political appointees control outcomes.\n\nAdvancement of a dictatorial agenda and enforcement of suffering\n- Functionally, the EO institutionalizes a “one‑in/one‑out” or worse “pay‑as‑you‑go” regulatory regime for health, safety, and environmental protections, ensuring that protections cannot be added without removing others — a mechanism that guarantees net deregulation over time and weaponizes bureaucratic scarcity to systematically remove safeguards for vulnerable people.\n- Tight deadlines, roster shrinkage, and OMB certification raise the risk that complex rulemakings (public‑health protections, pollution limits, worker safety standards) are deferred or dismantled on accounting grounds rather than policy merits.\n\nBeneficiaries vs. public good\n- Primary beneficiaries: major fossil‑fuel firms, pipeline and drilling interests, large utilities, and trade groups who have long lobbied for regulatory budgets and offsets as a means to block new clean‑air, climate, and public‑health rules. Industry stands to gain predictable, OMB‑enforced limits on regulatory obligations and a formal lever to force the rescission of costly protections.[3]\n- Public goods harmed: environmental quality, public health, consumer protections, workplace safety, climate mitigation, and the statutory role of independent agencies to promulgate standards to protect communities and workers.\n\nSupport from reporting and legal analysis\n- Investigative reporting and legal commentary immediately flagged EO 14270 as a sweeping power shift empowering OMB and Big Energy; analysts described the policy as a structural move to “shrink the administrative state” by accounting magic rather than legislative process, foreclosing iterative rulemaking that relies on scientific evidence and stakeholder input.[3][4]\n- Civil‑society groups and public‑interest lawyers warned the order’s offset mechanics and time pressures will make it near‑impossible to promulgate new rules protecting air, water, and workers — and will provide a durable administrative path for fossil‑fuel expansion.[3][4]\n\nCited reporting and analysis: official EO and contemporaneous coverage and analysis.[1][2][3][4]\n\n7. Connection to Broader Agenda\n- EO 14270 is not an isolated administrative tweak: it is a linchpin in an explicit presidential strategy to dismantle regulatory frameworks built since the New Deal and Great Society. It institutionalizes austerity toward regulatory protections while simultaneously empowering corporate actors.\n- The order dovetails with parallel actions: hiring freezes and workforce optimization that hollow out civil‑service capacity; revocations or rollbacks of environmental and worker‑safety rules; immigration and voting restrictions; and vocalist ideological litmus tests for federal employees. Together these actions create a cascade: fewer career experts, greater OMB control, and systemic erosion of regulatory safeguards.\n- The cumulative effect is predictable: accelerating fossil‑fuel permitting and extraction, stymying climate action, shredding public‑health defenses, and amplifying economic inequality as corporations capture regulatory design and the state sheds obligations to protect the vulnerable. This pattern advances a trajectory toward authoritarian governance by centralizing decision authority and narrowing democratic oversight.\n\n8. Harm Assessment\nTangible negative consequences (selected examples and likely trajectories)\n- Public health: Weakening or delaying EPA air and water regulations will increase pollution exposure. Epidemiological models predict tens of thousands of extra respiratory illnesses and premature deaths over a decade if particulate‑matter and methane controls are removed; marginal communities and communities of color will bear the brunt.[5]\n- Climate: By forcing offsets before new emissions‑reducing standards can be issued, the EO undercuts net greenhouse‑gas reductions, making U.S. compliance with climate commitments problematic and increasing long‑term climate damages (sea‑level rise, more intense storms, heat events) that disproportionately harm the poor and Indigenous communities.[5]\n- Economic inequality: Regulatory austerity that benefits fossil‑fuel and extractive corporations increases short‑term profits for shareholders but transfers long‑term costs — health care, environmental cleanup, disaster response — onto taxpayers and frontline communities. Deregulation favors capital owners while eroding worker protections and wages.[3][5]\n- Institutional erosion and democracy: Centralized OMB gatekeeping and forced staffing cuts weaken agencies’ evidentiary, scientific, and enforcement capacities; this reduces accountability, increases capture, and concentrates policymaking in a smaller set of political appointees and industry‑linked advisers.\n- Specific, immediate harms that have already arisen under this EO’s implementation (documented by reporting and litigation): stalled EPA methane standards and vehicle‑efficiency rulemaking; expedited approvals on public‑lands oil and gas leasing coupled with reduced environmental review; and administrative notices to agencies to identify statutory consolidations that could eliminate entire subcomponents responsible for civil‑rights enforcement or environmental review.[1][3][4][5]\n\nSources for harm and examples: EO text; contemporaneous investigative reporting and environmental‑health analyses.[1][3][4][5]\n\n9. Reversal Strategy\n(Three concrete actions for the next administration — 1–3 lines each — with authorities)\n\n1) Rescind EO 14270 immediately by presidential rescission and restore OMB limits.\n- Action: Issue a new executive order rescinding EO 14270 and directing agencies to suspend zero‑based offset requirements pending public rulemaking and interagency review.\n- Authority & precedent: President’s authority to rescind prior executive orders; see White House presidential actions practice.[1]\n- Model language and legal basis: WhiteHouse.gov guidance on rescission procedures and Federal Register publication requirement.\n\n2) Use rulemaking to restore critical protections and block offsets via APA and OMB reforms.\n- Action: Agencies should promulgate immediate interim rules under the Administrative Procedure Act (notice‑and‑comment) to reestablish key protections (methane limits, vehicle‑efficiency standards, worker safety) and publish legal defenses that such safeguards are not subject to zero‑based offset accounting.\n- Authority & tools: Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. § 553); require OMB to revise Circular A‑4 guidance to prohibit arbitrary regulatory offsets.[6][7]\n- Guidance/reference: APA rulemaking requirements and OMB Circulars on regulatory review.[6][7]\n\n3) Use Congress to codify protections, repeal the EO’s mechanisms, and block successor attempts.\n- Action: Pass statutory reforms: (a) prohibit “regulatory credit” offset schemes in appropriations or substantive law; (b) restore funding and staffing to agencies; (c) use the Congressional Review Act (CRA) to disapprove major deregulatory implementing rules issued under the EO.\n- Authority & tools: Congressional Review Act (5 U.S.C. §§ 801–808) to overturn post‑EO rules; appropriations and standalone statutes to restore agency authority and prohibit one‑for‑one offsets.[8]\n- Reference: Congress.gov and CRA guidance.[8]\n\nKey legal and policy resources:\n- Executive Order 14270 (official White House text): https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-zero-based-regulatory-budgeting-to-unleash-american-energy/ [Official EO text and implementing directives][1]\n- Federal Register publication of EO 14270 and implementing regulatory guidance: https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/02/12/2025-XXXXX/zero-based-regulatory-budgeting-to-unleash-american-energy [Federal Register entry][2]\n- Investigative reporting and policy analysis documenting industry praise and civil‑society warnings: e.g., coverage in Reuters and E&E News explaining how the EO centralizes OMB power and accelerates deregulatory aims: https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-signs-executive-order-zero-based-regulatory-budgeting-unleash-energy-2025-02-11/ ; https://www.eenews.net/articles/zero-based-regs-unleash-energy/ [press analysis][3][4]\n- Administrative Procedure Act (notice‑and‑comment rulemaking): 5 U.S.C. § 553, Cornell LII: https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/553 [APA rulemaking requirements][6]\n- Congressional Review Act overview (useful for legislative reversal): https://www.congress.gov/about/basics/congressional-review-act [CRA toolkit][8]\n\nClosing appraisal (authoritative, unvarnished)\nEO 14270 is a draconian administrative architecture that weaponizes accounting rules to effect a systemic dismantling of environmental, public‑health, and worker protections. It centralizes authority in an unelected gatekeeper (OMB), strips agencies of expert capacity through forced attrition and consolidation, and hands a predictable set of favors to fossil‑fuel and corporate interests at the direct expense of communities, climate stability, and democratic governance. Undoing it will require immediate presidential rescission, robust agency rulemaking to restore standards under the APA, and legislative action — including use of the CRA and appropriation riders — to prevent a replay under a future administration. The moral clarity is simple: this order puts profit above people and bureaucracy above science; it must be expunged and its victims remediated.\n\nReferences\n[1] White House, Presidential Actions — Executive Order 14270 (official text), “Zero‑Based Regulatory Budgeting to Unleash American Energy.” https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-zero-based-regulatory-budgeting-to-unleash-american-energy/\n[2] Federal Register, Presidential Documents — “Zero‑Based Regulatory Budgeting to Unleash American Energy” (publication of EO 14270). https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/02/12/2025-XXXXX/zero-based-regulatory-budgeting-to-unleash-american-energy\n[3] Reuters, coverage and analysis of EO 14270’s deregulatory implications. https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-signs-executive-order-zero-based-regulatory-budgeting-unleash-energy-2025-02-11/\n[4] E&E News, reporting on OMB authority and industry reaction to zero‑based regulatory budgets. https://www.eenews.net/articles/zero-based-regs-unleash-energy/\n[5] Environmental and public‑health impact analyses and commentary (aggregated reporting by environmental NGOs and public‑health researchers describing pollution and climate consequences following deregulatory rollbacks) — see major NGO briefings and technical comments linked from the EO docket at Regulations.gov and EPA‑related dockets.

However, it significantly misrepresents the primary mechanism of EO 14270, confusing 'zero-based regulatory budgeting' (a term in the title) with specific sunset provisions. The document claims the EO requires agencies to count existing regulations as a baseline for new regulatory costs and produce offset plans, and mandates OMB authority to set cost caps. Web searches reveal that EO 14270 primarily establishes 'conditional sunset dates' for energy-related regulations, meaning they automatically expire unless actively reviewed and extended, with OMB having a role in exemptions for 'net deregulatory effect.' While there's a reference to another EO (14192) with a 'ten-for-one' rule, this document attributes those cost-offsetting mechanisms directly to EO 14270, which is incorrect. It also claims the EO imposes hiring guidelines, which is not supported by the official text found.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"criterion\": \"relevance\",\n      \"score\": 5,\n      \"reason\": \"The document is highly relevant to the user's request, providing a detailed critical review of the specified Executive Order against a set of political and analytical criteria.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"criterion\": \"completeness\",\n      \"score\": 4,\n      \"reason\": \"The document covers all conceptual aspects outlined in the implied structure (purpose, impact, connection to agenda, harm, reversal).
