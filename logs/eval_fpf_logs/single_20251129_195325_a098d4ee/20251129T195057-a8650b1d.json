“Critical minerals” are defined by reference to the USGS Critical Minerals List under the Energy Act of 2020 (plus uranium), a list that is periodically expanded (most recently to include copper, silver, lead, etc.).([govinfo.gov](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/DCPD-202500482/html/DCPD-202500482.htm))  \n  - “Processed critical minerals” include all processing from oxide concentrates to metals and master alloys.  \n  - “Derivative products” are **any goods that incorporate processed critical minerals**, from wafers and battery anodes to final goods like EVs, smartphones, wind turbines, radar systems, and optical devices.([whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/ensuring-national-security-and-economic-resilience-through-section-232-actions-on-processed-critical-minerals-and-derivative-products/))  \n\n- **Imposes an aggressive, closed policy process and timeline**  \n  Requires the Secretary of Commerce to:\n  - Within 90 days: circulate a draft interim report to Treasury, Defense, USTR, and key White House economic/trade aides.  \n  - Within 15 days: receive their comments.  \n  - Within 180 days: submit a final report and recommendations to the President.([whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/ensuring-national-security-and-economic-resilience-through-section-232-actions-on-processed-critical-minerals-and-derivative-products/))  \n\n- **Channels the outcome toward tariffs and import restrictions**  \n  Explicitly instructs Commerce to consider:\n  - Tariffs and other import restrictions and “their appropriate levels.”  \n  - Anti‑circumvention safeguards and measures to prevent “weakening” of Section 232 measures.  \n  - “Policies to incentivize domestic production, processing, and recycling.”  \n  - “Any additional measures” under the President’s authority pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA).([whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/ensuring-national-security-and-economic-resilience-through-section-232-actions-on-processed-critical-minerals-and-derivative-products/))  \n\n- **Pre-positions Section 232 tariffs to override Trump’s “reciprocal” tariffs**  \n  The official fact sheet states that if Commerce finds a national security threat and Trump chooses to impose Section 232 tariffs, the new 232 tariff rate will **replace the currently paused “reciprocal” tariff rate** enacted by earlier Trump orders.([whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/04/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-ensures-national-security-and-economic-resilience-through-section-232-actions-on-processed-critical-minerals-and-derivative-products/))  \n\n- **Adds boilerplate to shield the order from legal challenge**  \n  Includes standard language that the EO:\n  - Does not limit existing agency legal authority.  \n  - Must be implemented consistent with law and appropriations.  \n  - Creates no enforceable rights for private parties.([govinfo.gov](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/DCPD-202500482/html/DCPD-202500482.htm))  \n\nIn other words, EO 14272 builds the procedural scaffolding for a massive expansion of Section 232 trade powers over the entire critical‑minerals value chain and any product that uses those minerals.  \n\n---\n\n## Stated Purpose & Justification\n\nIn its own words and supporting documents, the administration justifies EO 14272 as follows:\n\n1. **National security and defense industrial base**  \n   - The EO asserts that processed critical minerals and their derivative products are “foundational” to U.S. national security and defense, citing their use in jet engines, missile guidance systems, advanced computing, radar, optics, and secure communications.([whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/ensuring-national-security-and-economic-resilience-through-section-232-actions-on-processed-critical-minerals-and-derivative-products/))  \n   - It claims U.S. manufacturing and defense bases “remain dependent” on foreign sources at risk of long‑term shocks, which could produce shortages and undermine defense readiness.([govinfo.gov](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/DCPD-202500482/html/DCPD-202500482.htm))  \n\n2. **Economic security and “resilience”**  \n   - The EO equates economic security with national security, arguing that critical mineral processing underpins modern infrastructure, transportation, telecommunications, and advanced manufacturing—hence any import disruption threatens “price stability” and “economic prosperity and resilience.”([whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/ensuring-national-security-and-economic-resilience-through-section-232-actions-on-processed-critical-minerals-and-derivative-products/))  \n   - This rhetoric echoes the USGS and DOI framing that critical minerals have high “supply risk” due to import reliance and concentrated production, especially in China.([usgs.gov](https://www.usgs.gov/programs/mineral-resources-program/science/about-2025-list-critical-minerals?utm_source=openai))  \n\n3. **Foreign “weaponization” of minerals and supply chains**  \n   - The White House fact sheet highlights:\n     - Chinese export controls on gallium, germanium, and heavy rare earth metals.  \n     - Price manipulation, overcapacity, and export restrictions by major foreign processors.([whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/04/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-ensures-national-security-and-economic-resilience-through-section-232-actions-on-processed-critical-minerals-and-derivative-products/))  \n   - Commerce’s Section 232 notice similarly stresses China’s role as dominant processor for the majority of critical minerals and warns that this dominance is a tool of “geopolitical and economic leverage.”([bis.gov](https://www.bis.gov/press-release/commerce-launches-section-232-investigation-imports-processed-critical-minerals-derivative-products?utm_source=openai))  \n\n4. **Tool: Section 232 investigations and possible tariffs**  \n   - The White House claims that a Section 232 investigation is a neutral, statutory process to:\n     - Map imports and supply chains.  \n     - Assess vulnerabilities and foreign “distortions.”  \n     - Recommend trade remedies—including tariffs—to secure a stable domestic supply.([whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/04/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-ensures-national-security-and-economic-resilience-through-section-232-actions-on-processed-critical-minerals-and-derivative-products/))  \n\n5. **Continuity with Trump’s broader “America First” trade policy**  \n   - The fact sheet frames EO 14272 as the logical continuation of Trump’s revived steel and aluminum tariffs and his aborted “Liberation Day” global tariff scheme, all justified as defending national security from unfair trade.([whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/04/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-ensures-national-security-and-economic-resilience-through-section-232-actions-on-processed-critical-minerals-and-derivative-products/))  \n\nOn the surface, then, EO 14272 purports to be a technocratic risk assessment and insurance policy: an orderly investigation leading to targeted measures to ensure national security and economic resilience.  \n\n---\n\n## Nefarious Reality & True Impact\n\nBeneath the careful legalese, EO 14272 is best understood as a **structural power‑grab**: it weaponizes the “national security” label to concentrate economic authority in the presidency, entrench corporate interests, and install a durable tariff‑based economic regime that can be steered at will.\n\n### 1. Turning Section 232 into an all‑purpose economic cudgel\n\n- **Section 232 is already notorious for abuse.**  \n  Trump’s earlier use of Section 232 to impose 2018 steel and aluminum tariffs was widely condemned as protectionism in national‑security clothing. Scholarly and policy analyses document how the administration stretched the statute, manipulated deadlines, and treated “national security” as synonymous with generic economic welfare.([cato.org](https://www.cato.org/policy-analysis/protectionism-or-national-security-use-abuse-section-232?utm_source=openai))  \n\n- **EO 14272 radically broadens the target.**  \n  Steel and aluminum were already controversial; EO 14272 extends the same logic to **every processed critical mineral and every product that uses them**—from EV batteries and semiconductors to smartphones and wind‑turbine gearboxes. The NMMA summary correctly notes that the investigation’s scope extends to “downstream products” that simply *contain* these minerals.([nmma.org](https://www.nmma.org/press/article/25073?utm_source=openai))  \n\n- **The definitional ratchet ensures automatic expansion.**  \n  Because “critical minerals” are defined by reference to the USGS list, which the Trump administration is actively expanding (e.g., adding copper, silver, metallurgical coal, lead, etc.), the EO’s coverage grows every time the list grows—without new congressional authorization and with minimal public scrutiny.([usgs.gov](https://www.usgs.gov/programs/mineral-resources-program/science/about-2025-list-critical-minerals?utm_source=openai))  \n\nThis is a classic authoritarian move: **embed a broad delegation in apparently technical definitions**, then expand those definitions administratively to pull entire sectors under direct presidential control.\n\n### 2. Using tariffs as a permanent, regressive tax and leverage instrument\n\n- **The working model is not hypothetical; it’s copper.**  \n  In parallel with EO 14272, Trump launched a Section 232 investigation into copper, culminating in a **50% tariff on copper imports effective August 1, 2025**—explicitly justified on national security grounds.([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-announces-50-tariff-copper-effective-august-1-2025-07-10/?utm_source=openai)) Copper is now on the critical‑minerals list, and its tariffs are already driving up prices and provoking diplomatic pushback from Chile and other suppliers.  \n\n- **Even business trade groups warn these tariffs undermine security.**  \n  The National Foreign Trade Council (NFTC), hardly a left‑wing outfit, cautioned in its Section 232 comments that tariffs on processed critical minerals will mostly **raise costs for U.S. manufacturers and make their products less competitive**, without providing viable alternative supplies in the short or medium term.([nftc.org](https://www.nftc.org/nftc-cautions-against-tariffs-on-critical-minerals/?utm_source=openai))  \n\n- **Yet the administration is explicit that Section 232 is the work‑around after IEEPA losses.**  \n  Courts have already struck down Trump’s sweeping global “Liberation Day” tariffs imposed under IEEPA as an illegal use of emergency powers, while leaving Section 232 tariffs in place.([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/b714cfc8dff51289b1d5291f46d71f3f?utm_source=openai)) EO 14272, by leaning heavily on Section 232 and even pointing back to those earlier reciprocal tariffs, is a deliberate pivot: **when emergency powers are constrained, rebrand the same agenda as “national security” and embed it in Section 232.**\n\nIn effect, EO 14272 creates a **standing capacity to impose regressive, quasi‑permanent taxes on enormous swaths of the economy**—under presidential discretion, without meaningful congressional control.\n\n### 3. Plutocratic capture: minerals policy as corporate welfare\n\n- **Industry lobbying and narratives are baked into the policy frame.**  \n  The National Mining Association and allied groups have hammered on U.S. import dependence—49 mineral commodities more than 50% import‑reliant and 15 entirely dependent—to argue for aggressive “mineral security” measures.([nma.org](https://nma.org/2024/01/31/usgs-shows-deep-ongoing-vulnerabilities-in-mineral-supply-chains/?utm_source=openai)) Those data are real, but the proposed remedies consistently foreground subsidies, deregulation, and tariffs that benefit mining and smelting firms.\n\n- **Concrete example: copper smelters shielded from pollution rules in the name of “mineral security.”**  \n  In October 2025, Trump reversed a Biden‑era EPA rule forcing copper smelters to cut emissions of lead, arsenic, mercury, benzene, and dioxins, granting a two‑year exemption and explicitly justifying it as necessary to “promote American mineral security” and avoid weakening U.S. copper capacity. Freeport‑McMoRan immediately praised the move.([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/climate-energy/trump-reverses-biden-era-rules-copper-smelters-2025-10-24/))  \n\n- **The same playbook is now being scaled up across all critical minerals.**  \n  By tying mineral processing and derivative manufacturing to national security, EO 14272 gives corporate lobbies a simple, powerful rhetoric: any regulation, tax, or labor standard that increases their costs allegedly “threatens our mineral independence” and therefore national security. The likely result is a **systematic skewing of federal policy toward mining companies and heavy industry**, at the expense of workers, communities, and the climate.\n\nThis is not incidental—it is **structural plutocratic entrenchment** disguised as patriotic reindustrialization.\n\n### 4. Environmental sacrifice zones under a “security” banner\n\n- **Section 232 and “mineral security” are already being used to justify environmental rollbacks.**  \n  Beyond copper, the administration is rolling back 2024 soot (PM2.5) standards for power plants and industry—rules projected to avoid thousands of premature deaths annually—again siding with states and industry to emphasize cost and “reliability” over health.([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/us-epa-seeks-scrap-tougher-soot-limits-critics-warn-health-risks-2025-11-25/?utm_source=openai)) The same narrative—domestic capacity and grid reliability as security imperatives—pervades its Section 232 rhetoric.  \n\n- **EO 14272 locks in that logic for decades.**  \n  Once processed critical minerals and their derivative products are defined as core security assets, every future fight over tailings dams, air toxics standards, water contamination, or Indigenous land rights can be recast as a test of “whose side you’re on”—national security and “resilience,” or “foreign green radicals.” Given the long history of extractive projects poisoning Indigenous and rural communities (e.g., the Church Rock uranium spill and Black Mesa coal controversy), this is a recipe for **repeating environmental injustice under a national‑security fig leaf**.([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_Rock_uranium_mill_spill?utm_source=openai))  \n\nIn sum, EO 14272 is not a neutral study of mineral risks. It is a **blueprint for using national security as a shield for corporate enrichment, environmental degradation, and unilateral presidential control over wide swaths of the economy.**  \n\n---\n\n## Connection to Broader Agenda\n\nEO 14272 fits seamlessly into the Trump administration’s broader authoritarian‑nationalist project in at least four ways:\n\n1. **Concentration of economic power in the presidency**\n\n   - Trump’s second term has aggressively weaponized Section 232 to re‑impose and escalate steel and aluminum tariffs (now up to 50%), explicitly framing them as presidential tools to override multilateral trade norms and bilateral exemptions.([whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/02/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-restores-section-232-tariffs/?utm_source=openai))  \n   - Bipartisan bills like the Warner–Toomey Congressional Trade Authority Act arose precisely because Congress recognizes how Section 232 has been abused to bypass legislative authority and damage relationships with allies.([warner.senate.gov](https://www.warner.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2021/10/warner-toomey-reintroduce-legislation-to-restore-authority-over-national-tariffs?utm_source=openai)) EO 14272 presses further in the same direction: global economic policy by presidential fiat, justified by malleable “security” claims.\n\n2. **End‑running judicial constraints on emergency powers**\n\n   - When courts blocked Trump’s sweeping IEEPA‑based Liberation Day tariffs as exceeding emergency powers, they notably **left Section 232 tariffs intact**.([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/b714cfc8dff51289b1d5291f46d71f3f?utm_source=openai))  \n   - EO 14272 explicitly tells Commerce to consider “additional measures” under IEEPA alongside Section 232 remedies, knitting the two authorities together.([govinfo.gov](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/DCPD-202500482/html/DCPD-202500482.htm)) This is a calculated attempt to **rebuild an emergency‑style tariff apparatus inside the more deferential Section 232 framework**—a textbook authoritarian tactic of shifting power to less constrained legal channels after judicial pushback.\n\n3. **Systemic dismantling of the regulatory state**\n\n   - EO 14272 does not operate in isolation; it coexists with Trump’s draconian deregulation orders (e.g., requiring agencies to repeal multiple rules for every new one, and empowering OMB to discipline independent agencies that deviate from presidential priorities).([amcp.org](https://www.amcp.org/amcp-trump-administration-actions-tracker))  \n   - Trade and mineral policy thus become double‑edged tools: tariffs and import rules to reward favored sectors, and deregulation plus “gold‑standard science” rhetoric to attack environmental, labor, and health protections viewed as obstacles.\n\n4. **Ideological fusion of nationalism, extraction, and grievance**\n\n   - The administration’s messaging around EO 14272, steel/aluminum tariffs, and copper tariffs relentlessly ties **economic pain and deindustrialization to foreign enemies and “global freeloaders”**, rather than to domestic policy choices or corporate decisions.([whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/04/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-ensures-national-security-and-economic-resilience-through-section-232-actions-on-processed-critical-minerals-and-derivative-products/))  \n   - The political utility is obvious: it channels legitimate fears about supply chains and jobs into support for a leader who promises protection through executive action, while delegitimizing domestic critics as aiding adversaries.\n\nHistorically, this fusion of **hyper‑centralized economic authority, nationalist grievance, and corporate alliance around extractive industries** is a familiar pattern in authoritarian and proto‑fascist regimes. EO 14272 is one more ratchet turn in that direction.\n\n---\n\n## Harm Assessment\n\nBecause the Section 232 investigation is still ongoing and the full suite of tariffs under EO 14272 has not yet been finalized, the harms fall into two categories: **already observable impacts from related actions** and **high‑probability impacts given the legal architecture now in place.**\n\n### 1. Economic and trade harms\n\n- **Price spikes and cascading cost‑of‑living impacts**  \n  - Trump’s 50% copper tariff provides a preview: copper futures spiked to record highs, with downstream sectors from EVs to electronics facing sharply higher input costs.([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-announces-50-tariff-copper-effective-august-1-2025-07-10/?utm_source=openai))  \n  - Applying similar tariffs across dozens of processed critical minerals and derivative products would function as a **broad, regressive consumption tax**, hitting households through higher prices for cars, appliances, phones, and energy.\n\n- **Damage to export competitiveness and manufacturing jobs**  \n  - The NFTC warns that tariffs on critical minerals will “make U.S. products less competitive globally,” undermining the very industries (autos, electronics, clean energy) the administration claims to protect.([nftc.org](https://www.nftc.org/nftc-cautions-against-tariffs-on-critical-minerals/?utm_source=openai))  \n  - Allies and key suppliers—Chile for copper, Japan for steel, EU partners—are already protesting Trump’s tariffs as protectionist and destabilizing, with clear risks of retaliatory measures and investment diversion.([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/chinas-iron-steel-association-says-us-tariff-increase-impact-global-supply-chain-2025-02-13/?utm_source=openai))  \n\n- **Supply chain fragility, not resilience**  \n  - By raising the cost of imports without rapidly deployable domestic alternatives, EO 14272’s logic risks **concentrating supply in a smaller club of domestic and politically favored suppliers**, amplifying vulnerability to domestic shocks and political cycles rather than diversifying and hardening supply chains in a genuinely resilient manner.\n\n### 2. Environmental and public health harms\n\n- **Rollback of pollution controls under the guise of mineral security**  \n  - The copper smelter exemption will mean higher emissions of potent neurotoxins and carcinogens (lead, arsenic, mercury, dioxins) for at least two more years, primarily affecting low‑income and Indigenous communities near smelting facilities.([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/climate-energy/trump-reverses-biden-era-rules-copper-smelters-2025-10-24/))  \n  - The parallel assault on soot standards—rules expected to prevent thousands of premature deaths and hundreds of thousands of asthma cases—shows the administration’s willingness to **sacrifice public health wholesale in the name of “industrial base” and “grid reliability.”**([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/us-epa-seeks-scrap-tougher-soot-limits-critics-warn-health-risks-2025-11-25/?utm_source=openai))  \n\n- **Intensified pressure for ecologically destructive mining and processing**  \n  - USGS and DOI data confirm that China dominates processing for many high‑risk critical minerals, but the Trump response is to pursue rapid domestic extraction without a commensurate commitment to environmental justice, Indigenous consent, or robust reclamation.([usgs.gov](https://www.usgs.gov/programs/mineral-resources-program/science/about-2025-list-critical-minerals?utm_source=openai))  \n  - Given historic precedents like Church Rock (uranium) and Black Mesa (coal), the likely result is **new sacrifice zones on or near tribal and rural lands**, with long‑term contamination and health burdens that far outlast any jobs boom.([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_Rock_uranium_mill_spill?utm_source=openai))  \n\n### 3. Inequality, social, and global justice harms\n\n- **Regressive distributional effects**  \n  - Tariffs on basic industrial inputs push costs through the supply chain to consumers, functioning as a de facto flat tax that disproportionately harms low‑ and middle‑income households while boosting profits for well‑positioned extractive and processing firms.\n\n- **Harms to Global South producers and climate transition**  \n  - Chile and other mineral‑exporting democracies warn that unilateral U.S. tariffs could **weaken their economies and perversely strengthen China’s market position**, as exports are redirected at discount prices.([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/chile-pushes-back-against-trump-copper-tariff-probe-2025-04-15/?utm_source=openai))  \n  - Higher prices for critical minerals and related products will slow the deployment of clean energy technologies (EVs, solar, grid upgrades) domestically and globally, constraining the very climate transition that a sane security policy would accelerate.\n\n### 4. Democratic and institutional harms\n\n- **Normalization of presidential trade lawmaking**  \n  - EO 14272 conditions political elites and the public to accept that questions as vast as “How much should batteries, electronics, or cars cost?” are properly answered unilaterally by the President acting through opaque Section 232 processes, not through democratic debate and legislation.([warner.senate.gov](https://www.warner.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2021/10/warner-toomey-reintroduce-legislation-to-restore-authority-over-national-tariffs?utm_source=openai))  \n\n- **Entrenchment of “national security” as a catch‑all trump card**  \n  - Once everything from EVs to smartphones is framed as a security issue, opposition can be painted as appeasement or treasonous softness. That **shrinks the space for technocratic dispute and political dissent**, a hallmark of creeping authoritarianism.\n\n---\n\n## Reversal Strategy\n\nTo undo the damage from EO 14272 and prevent its logic from metastasizing, the next administration should pursue at least three concrete lines of action:\n\n1. **Immediate legal rollback and de‑escalation of Section 232 in minerals**\n\n   - **Rescind EO 14272 on Day One** and formally instruct Commerce to terminate or close the Section 232 investigation into processed critical minerals and derivative products with a finding of **no current national security impairment**, relying instead on USGS’s risk‑based framework for targeted stockpiling, recycling, and research.([whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/ensuring-national-security-and-economic-resilience-through-section-232-actions-on-processed-critical-minerals-and-derivative-products/))  \n   - Simultaneously **review and roll back existing 232 mineral tariffs** (e.g., the 50% copper tariff) and pollution exemptions justified by “mineral security,” prioritizing relief for downstream manufacturers and frontline communities.([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-announces-50-tariff-copper-effective-august-1-2025-07-10/?utm_source=openai))  \n\n2. **Structural reform of Section 232 authority and trade emergency powers**\n\n   - Champion and sign legislation along the lines of the **Bicameral Congressional Trade Authority Act**, requiring congressional approval for any future “national security” tariffs or quotas and narrowing the statutory definition of “national security” so that it cannot be equated with generalized economic complaints.([warner.senate.gov](https://www.warner.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2021/10/warner-toomey-reintroduce-legislation-to-restore-authority-over-national-tariffs?utm_source=openai))  \n   - Reinforce judicial constraints on IEEPA and similar statutes by explicitly prohibiting their use for broad revenue‑raising tariffs, codifying the principles already articulated in recent court decisions that struck down Trump’s emergency‑tariff overreach.([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/b714cfc8dff51289b1d5291f46d71f3f?utm_source=openai))  \n\n3. **Build an ethical, climate‑aligned mineral security strategy without blunt tariffs**\n\n   - Pivot from punitive tariffs to a strategy centered on **diversified allied sourcing, domestic recycling and substitution, and stringent environmental and labor standards**, drawing on USGS’s data‑driven supply‑risk work and DOI’s multi‑year critical‑minerals planning rather than ad hoc tariff announcements.([usgs.gov](https://www.usgs.gov/programs/mineral-resources-program/science/about-2025-list-critical-minerals?utm_source=openai))  \n   - Engage with industry and trade groups—including those that opposed Trump’s tariff‑heavy approach—to design incentives (tax credits, loan guarantees, public‑private partnerships) that expand processing capacity **without** weaponizing Section 232 or sacrificing public health, reflecting recommendations from stakeholders like the NFTC and NMMA.([nftc.org](https://www.nftc.org/nftc-cautions-against-tariffs-on-critical-minerals/?utm_source=openai))  \n\nTaken together, these steps would not only dismantle the specific machinery erected by EO 14272, but also **reassert democratic control over trade and industrial policy**, decouple mineral security from corporate impunity, and align U.S. economic strategy with environmental justice and genuine security—rather than with the authoritarian, plutocratic project that currently governs it.\n\n\nSingle-document evaluation payload placeholder."
