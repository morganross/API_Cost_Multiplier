Converts “National Security” into a Blank Check for Crony Capitalism\n\nSection 232 has already been widely criticized — including by the Government Accountability Office and mainstream economists — as a dangerously vague statute vulnerable to abuse for nakedly protectionist and political purposes.[^2] EO 14272 doubles down, using “processed critical minerals” as the pretext.\n\n- The order **collapses any distinction between genuine defense‑critical dependencies and generic industrial policy**, lumping together minerals for actual military hardware with inputs for fossil fuel and petrochemical expansion.  \n- By centralizing designation of “strategic firms and projects” in a White House council chaired by the National Security Advisor, the EO **hands a small circle of loyalists the power to pick winners and losers**, steering tariffs, subsidies, procurement, and permitting toward politically connected companies — including fossil‑fuel‑aligned mining conglomerates and domestic oligarchs already embedded in the Trump orbit.  \n- A similar pattern is documented in Trump’s second‑term use of executive orders to freeze or redirect funding to universities and media viewed as hostile, while rewarding loyal institutions.[^3] EO 14272 ports that same patronage logic into the minerals and energy space.\n\n### b. Uses Trade Law to Undermine Climate Action and Lock in Fossil Infrastructure\n\nDespite the “resilience” rhetoric, EO 14272 is structurally aligned with the administration’s broader assault on clean energy and climate policy:\n\n- After Trump’s earlier EOs freezing or terminating Inflation Reduction Act and infrastructure‑linked climate funds,[^4] EO 14272 **shifts the center of gravity back toward fossil‑fueled “energy dominance”**: LNG terminals, refineries, and petrochemical plants are explicitly favored as “strategic” endpoints for domestic mineral processing.  \n- By making “hostile foreign supply chains” the villain, the EO **politically inoculates expanded domestic mining and processing from environmental critique**, while simultaneously weakening NEPA review and public participation — mirroring the administration’s dismantling of environmental protections in other sectors.  \n- Tariffs and quotas targeted at minerals used heavily in solar, wind, and battery technologies (e.g., processed lithium, cobalt, nickel, rare earths) are likely to **raise costs for clean energy deployment**, slowing U.S. decarbonization while Trump simultaneously sabotages climate regulation elsewhere.[^4]\n\n### c. Centralizes Economic Power in the Executive and Erodes Democratic Accountability\n\nEO 14272 is part of a larger pattern in which the administration:\n\n- **Routinely uses executive orders to upend statutory schemes** (from DEI and civil rights enforcement in higher education[^5] to funding for media and infrastructure[^4]) without meaningful congressional involvement. The order weaponizes Section 232’s already‑loose delegation to the executive.  \n- **Short‑circuits procedural safeguards** by instructing agencies to compress public comment periods, expand categorical exclusions from NEPA, and treat national security as a trump card over community, tribal, and environmental objections.  \n- **Concentrates decision‑making in White House councils and “task forces”** that are largely insulated from FOIA and normal oversight, enabling informal pressure, political deal‑making, and retribution against perceived enemies.\n\nLegal scholars have warned that the Trump administration’s second‑term barrage of executive actions — particularly on trade, funding, and civil rights — reflects a systematic attempt to **normalize autocratic presidential control** over policy arenas that historically involved Congress, independent agencies, and courts.[^2][^5] EO 14272 is one more brick in that edifice.\n\n### d. Reproduces a “Security State” Logic to Criminalize Resistance\n\nThe EO’s framing — mining and processing as “frontline” national security infrastructure — will predictably be used to:\n\n- Cast opposition by Indigenous nations, environmental justice groups, and labor as aiding “foreign adversaries” or undermining “economic resilience.”  \n- Justify heavy‑handed policing around mining and processing sites, potentially leveraging the administration’s expanding domestic terrorism and “organized political violence” apparatus, already documented as disproportionately targeted at left‑leaning and environmental movements.[^6]  \n\nIn other words, EO 14272 **folds contested industrial projects into the national security state**, making protest itself easier to portray as subversive.\n\n---\n\n7. **Connection to Broader Agenda**\n\nEO 14272 is tightly interwoven with the administration’s wider authoritarian and extractivist program:\n\n- **Project 2025 & DEI Crackdown:** The same ideological blueprint behind the anti‑DEI EOs in education and federal contracting[^5][^7] envisions a government purged of equity considerations and fully mobilized in service of “America First” capital. EO 14272 operationalizes that in the minerals sector, ignoring tribal sovereignty, environmental justice, or labor protections.  \n- **Trade War as Permanent Mobilization:** Trump’s second‑term economic policy has embraced perpetual tariff escalation as a core governing tool, from blanket import duties to Section 232 steel and aluminum expansions.[^2][^4] EO 14272 extends this logic into a new, highly strategic commodity class, further entrenching a **wartime, siege‑economy framing** that justifies executive overreach and scapegoats foreign enemies for domestic inequality and under‑investment.  \n- **Retaliation and Patronage:** As with the freezing of funds to “unfriendly” universities[^3][^5] and defunding of media deemed “biased,”[^4] we can expect preferential designation of “strategic” projects in politically friendly states and districts, and punitive treatment of jurisdictions that resist mining or processing expansion. This hardwires partisan revenge into the supply‑chain architecture.  \n- **Fossil Authoritarianism:** Globally, authoritarian regimes increasingly rely on fossil rents and resource extraction to bankroll security states. Trump’s aggressive dismantling of environmental and human rights checks abroad[^8] and at home aligns with using domestic extraction — including critical minerals — as a fiscal and political base for illiberal rule.\n\nAltogether, EO 14272 supports a **neo‑petro‑minerals state**: centralized, belligerent, and hostile to pluralistic oversight.\n\n---\n\n8. **Harm Assessment**\n\nThe likely harms from EO 14272 span environmental, economic, social, and democratic dimensions.\n\n### a. Environmental Devastation & Climate Backsliding\n\n- Fast‑tracked mining and processing, stripped of robust environmental review, will **accelerate contamination of land, water, and air**, particularly in rural, Indigenous, and low‑income communities. Prior mining booms in the U.S. and abroad demonstrate the well‑documented legacy of toxic tailings, acid mine drainage, and cancer clusters.  \n- By raising costs for imported clean‑energy inputs while favoring fossil‑linked end uses, the EO **delays decarbonization** and locks in carbon‑intensive infrastructure — undermining domestic and international climate commitments and deepening future climate‑driven suffering.\n\n### b. Intensified Inequality and Corporate Power\n\n- Tariffs, quotas, and domestic content mandates are structured to **inflate profits for a narrow tier of domestic and “friendly” processing firms**, while consumers and downstream industries pay higher prices. As with Trump’s prior tariff waves, cost pass‑through will fall hardest on working‑class households, especially in energy and transport.[^4]  \n- Subsidies, loan guarantees, and procurement preferences funneled through the White House council will **reinforce oligarchic concentration**, entrenching politically loyal conglomerates that can then bankroll further illiberal politics.\n\n### c. Harm to Workers and Communities\n\n- Without strong labor standards or community benefits requirements, new processing plants are likely to **replicate exploitative, hazardous workplaces** and offload long‑term health and clean‑up costs onto local residents and future governments.  \n- Indigenous nations will face **renewed waves of resource colonialism**, with treaty rights and consent sidelined under the banner of “national security” — continuing a brutal historical pattern.\n\n### d. Democratic Erosion\n\n- The EO’s heavy reliance on Section 232 and executive discretion **further sidelines Congress** from central economic decisions, normalizing one‑man rule over complex trade and industrial systems.  \n- By securitizing mineral supply chains and conflating protest with subversion, the order **chills dissent** and invites escalation of surveillance and criminalization against environmental, tribal, and labor organizers — reinforcing the administration’s broader domestic repression toolkit.[^6]\n\n---\n\n9. **Reversal Strategy**\n\nA future democratic administration and Congress should move quickly and surgically:\n\n1. **Rescind EO 14272 and Constrain Section 232 Abuse**  \n   - Immediately revoke EO 14272 and any implementing memoranda; direct Commerce and USTR to roll back associated tariffs/quotas where not required by statute.  \n   - Work with Congress to amend Section 232 to narrow “national security,” require robust economic and environmental impact analysis, and mandate congressional approval for any new long‑term measures.[^2]  \n\n2. **Build a Just, Climate‑Centered Critical Minerals Policy**  \n   - Replace EO 14272 with a new framework statute and/or EO that:  \n     - Prioritizes demand reduction, recycling, and circular economy approaches;  \n     - Embeds free, prior, and informed consent (FPIC) for Indigenous communities;  \n     - Conditions any subsidies or procurement on high labor standards, community benefits agreements, and strict environmental safeguards.  \n   - Coordinate with allies through transparent, rights‑respecting supply‑chain alliances rather than unilateral tariffs.  \n\n3. **Re‑Democratize Economic Governance and Protect Protest**  \n   - Sunset or sharply limit opaque White House “coordination councils” that allocate subsidies and trade protections, returning core design powers to accountable agencies with clear rulemaking procedures.  \n   - Strengthen statutory protections for environmental and Indigenous‑rights defenders and prevent the use of domestic terrorism or “critical infrastructure” statutes to criminalize protest, drawing on civil liberties guidance from groups like the ACLU and international human rights norms.[^6][^8]  \n\nDone correctly, reversal will not mean naïve dependence on abusive foreign supply chains; it will mean **replacing EO 14272’s authoritarian resource nationalism with a democratic, climate‑sane, justice‑oriented minerals policy** that actually serves the public rather than an extraction‑drunk ruling clique.\n\n---\n\n[^1]: For a concise history of Trump’s use of “national security” tariffs in both terms, see GAO’s review of Section 232 actions and contemporary trade analyses (e.g., Peterson Institute, 2018‑2025).  \n[^2]: Government Accountability Office, “International Trade: Actions Needed to Improve Accountability and Transparency of Section 232 Process” (GAO‑20‑517).  \n[^3]: CNN, “Timeline: Harvard University vs. Trump Administration,” detailing the use of funding freezes as political punishment (Sept. 30, 2025). https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/26/us/harvard-university-trump-timeline  \n[^4]: Just Security, “Litigation Tracker: Legal Challenges to Trump Administration Actions” (2025), including EOs freezing IRA and infrastructure funds. https://www.justsecurity.org/107087/tracker-litigation-legal-challenges-trump-administration/  \n[^5]: The Conference Board, “Higher Education in Focus: Recent Federal Scrutiny Explained” (May 16, 2025), describing anti‑DEI EOs and mass funding cancellations. https://www.conference-board.org/research/ced-policy-backgrounders/higher-education-in-focus-recent-federal-scrutiny-explained  \n[^6]: White House, “Countering Domestic Terrorism and Organized Political Violence” (NSPM‑7, Sept. 25, 2025) and related analysis by Morgan Lewis & ArentFox Schiff on its enforcement implications for nonprofits and protest movements.  \n[^7]: Federal Register, “Ending Radical and Wasteful Government DEI Programs and Preferencing,” Exec.
