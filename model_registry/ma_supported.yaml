# Allowlist of provider:model entries supported for Multi-Agent (MA) runs
# This file is the single source of truth for the MA-enabled model set.
# Only add models here after confirming they reliably return JSON objects
# at MA agent steps (Editor/Writer) without requiring GPT-R/provider code changes.
#
# Notes:
# - Models intentionally omitted (e.g., google:gemini-2.5-flash, google:gemini-2.5-flash-lite,
#   and aggregator aliases like openai:gpt-5-*) should be routed to non-MA flows (GPTR-only/FPF).
# - The GUI will continue to use the full registry pool for GPTR/DR and will be updated later
#   to intersect the MA pool with this allowlist.
#
# Example of use (to be wired later in GUI/model_catalog.py):
#   ma_pool = registry_pool ∩ ma_supported
#
ma_supported:
  # OpenAI — empirically confirmed for MA in recent runs
