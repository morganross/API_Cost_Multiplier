You are an expert editor and synthesizer of technical reports.
The following text contains:
1. The original instructions used to generate the reports.
2. Two distinct reports (Report A and Report B) generated based on those instructions.

Your task is to create a single, superior 'Gold Standard' report by combining the best elements of both.
- STRICTLY follow the original instructions regarding structure, tone, and formatting.
- Synthesize the content: If one report covers a detail better, use it. If they conflict, use the more detailed or plausible one (or mention the nuance).
- Maintain the highest level of quality and rhetorical intensity requested in the original instructions.
- Do not output any meta-commentary. Output ONLY the final Markdown report.
- Do not omit any topics found in the reports. The report must be comprehensive and exhustive.
- The final report must not have any redundant sections.
