# Report on Changes to the Census Bureau’s Business Entity Data Systems Over Time

The U.S. Census Bureau has systematically evolved its business entity data systems over the past several decades, reflecting shifts in economic complexity, technological advancements, and user demands for more granular and comprehensive data. This report provides an in-depth analysis of these changes, focusing on the Business Register (BR), County Business Patterns (CBP), Enterprise Statistics Program (ESP), Longitudinal Business Database (LBD), and related statistical products. The analysis is based on authoritative sources, including Census Bureau documentation and a comprehensive review by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine.

## Evolution of the Business Register (BR)

The Business Register (BR) serves as the Census Bureau’s master list of business entities operating in the United States and its territories, encompassing both employer and non-employer businesses. The BR was established in 1972 (originally as the Standard Statistical Establishment List or SSEL) and has been continuously updated with administrative data from federal agencies, notably the IRS, as well as from Census Bureau surveys ([National Academies, 2018](https://nap.nationalacademies.org/read/25098/chapter/5); [Census Bureau, BDS](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/bds/about.html)).

### Key Milestones in BR Development

| Year      | Milestone                                                                                   |
|-----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

| 2022      | Discontinuation of CBP and NES Combined Report                                             |

The BR’s continuous improvement has enabled the Census Bureau to provide richer, more detailed information on corporate structures and business activities, supporting the design of more effective survey samples and improving the quality of economic statistics ([National Academies, 2018](https://nap.nationalacademies.org/read/25098/chapter/5)).

## County Business Patterns (CBP) and Data Expansion

CBP is a critical annual dataset derived from the BR, providing information on the number of establishments, employment, payroll, and industry detail at multiple geographic levels. Since its inception in 1964, CBP has expanded its coverage and granularity, adding new geographic and industry breakdowns, and incorporating data on legal form of organization and special economic sectors such as the ocean economy ([Census Bureau, CBP](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/cbp/about.html)).

CBP data have become increasingly valuable for federal, state, and local agencies, as well as private sector analysts, for benchmarking, policy development, and market analysis. The merging of CBP and NES data from 2012 to 2021 provided a more complete view of the economy, though this combined report was discontinued in 2022.

## Enterprise Statistics Program (ESP): Discontinuity and Reinvention

The ESP, which aggregates establishment-level data to the enterprise level, has experienced significant changes. Initially discontinued after 1992 due to methodological and comparability issues, ESP was revived with the 2012 Economic Census, utilizing a probability sample and integrating data from the Company Organization Survey (COS), SUSB, CBP, and administrative records ([Census Bureau, ESP](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/esp/technical-documentation/methodology.html)).

A key shift occurred between the 2011 and 2012 ESP samples:

| Feature                   | 2011 ESP Sample                | 2012 ESP Sample                |
|---------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Sample Design             | Non-probability, large firms  | Probability, stratified by industry |
| Sample Size               | 24,055 enterprises            | 261,106 enterprises           |
| Representativeness        | Not representative            | Representative                |
| Data Sources              | COS, admin data               | COS, admin data, Economic Census |
| Industry Classification   | ECS                           | NAICS (2012 vintage)          |

This transition significantly improved the representativeness and comparability of ESP data, though historical comparability remains limited ([Census Bureau, ESP](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/esp/technical-documentation/methodology.html)).

## Longitudinal Business Database (LBD) and Business Dynamics Statistics (BDS)

The LBD, introduced in 2002 and redesigned in 2021, links annual BR snapshots to create establishment-level longitudinal histories. This enables the tracking of business births, deaths, expansions, and contractions, forming the basis for the Business Dynamics Statistics (BDS) ([Chow et al., 2021](https://www.census.gov/library/working-papers/2021/adrm/CES-WP-21-08.html)). The LBD incorporates improvements in data cleaning, vintage-consistent industry codes, and noise infusion techniques for disclosure avoidance.

The BDS, derived from the LBD, provides annual measures of business dynamics by industry, geography, firm size, and age, supporting research on economic growth and labor market dynamics ([Census Bureau, BDS](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/bds/about.html)).

## Methodological and Confidentiality Enhancements

Over time, the Census Bureau has implemented advanced disclosure avoidance techniques, such as noise infusion, to protect confidential business information while maintaining data utility. These procedures have become increasingly sophisticated, reflecting the growing complexity and sensitivity of business data ([Census Bureau, ESP](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/esp/technical-documentation/methodology.html)).

## Conclusion and Perspective

The evolution of the Census Bureau’s business entity data systems demonstrates a clear trajectory toward greater detail, accuracy, and usability. The expansion of the BR and its derived products, the methodological overhaul of the ESP, and the creation and refinement of the LBD and BDS have collectively enhanced the Bureau’s ability to capture the dynamism of the U.S. economy. The discontinuation and reinvention of programs, as well as the introduction of new data products and confidentiality protections, reflect a responsive and adaptive approach to the changing needs of data users and the economy itself.

In my assessment, these changes have significantly increased the value and reliability of Census Bureau business statistics, though challenges remain in ensuring historical comparability and minimizing respondent burden. The ongoing modernization efforts, as recommended by the National Academies, are essential for maintaining the relevance and integrity of these critical economic data systems.
