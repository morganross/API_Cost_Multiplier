## Did Trump Change the Name of the Department of Defense?

### Historical Context

The U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) was originally established as the Department of War in 1789, a title it held until 1947. The National Security Act of 1947, signed by President Harry Truman, reorganized the military and renamed the department to the National Military Establishment, which was subsequently changed to the Department of Defense in 1949 ([Euronews, 2025](https://www.euronews.com/2025/09/05/why-has-trump-renamed-the-us-department-of-defense-to-department-of-war)).

### Executive Order and Implementation

On September 5, 2025, President Donald Trump signed an executive order authorizing the use of “secondary titles” such as “Department of War” and “Secretary of War” in official and public contexts. However, the legal name of the department remains “Department of Defense” until Congress enacts a formal change ([White House, 2025](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/09/restoring-the-united-states-department-of-war/)). The order directs the Secretary of Defense (now referred to in secondary contexts as Secretary of War) to recommend legislative actions for a permanent renaming and to notify Congress of any office or agency using the new titles.

#### Key Provisions of the Executive Order

- **Secondary Titles**: Authorizes the use of “Department of War” and “Secretary of War” in official correspondence, ceremonial contexts, and public communications.
- **Legislative Recommendation**: Requires the Secretary of War to submit recommendations for permanent legal renaming within 60 days.
- **Congressional Notification**: Mandates notification to Congress of any office or agency adopting the secondary titles.
- **Statutory References**: All legal references to the Department of Defense remain controlling until changed by law ([White House, 2025](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/09/restoring-the-united-states-department-of-war/)).

### Legal and Political Implications

While the executive order represents a significant symbolic shift, it does not have the force of law to change the department’s official name. Congressional approval is required for a formal legal name change. The move has sparked political and legal controversy, with critics arguing it signals a more aggressive military posture and supporters claiming it restores historical clarity and projects strength ([Euronews, 2025](https://www.euronews.com/2025/09/05/why-has-trump-renamed-the-us-department-of-defense-to-department-of-war)).

### Analysis and Opinion

Based on the available evidence, President Trump has not legally changed the name of the Department of Defense. The executive order allows for the use of “Department of War” as a secondary title in certain contexts, but the official, statutory name remains unchanged. The move is primarily symbolic and intended to project a more assertive image of American military power. The reliance on secondary titles without congressional approval underscores the limitations of executive authority in this domain. In my assessment, while the rebranding may have rhetorical and cultural impact, it does not constitute a substantive legal transformation of the department’s identity.

## Did Trump Attack Cartel Boats?

### Background and Context

The issue of drug cartels operating maritime vessels to smuggle narcotics into the United States has been a persistent national security concern. Previous administrations have authorized military and Coast Guard actions against such threats, but the Trump administration has signaled a more aggressive stance.

### Recent Military Actions

In early September 2025, multiple reputable news outlets reported that U.S. military forces, under direct authorization from President Trump, engaged and destroyed several cartel-operated boats in the Gulf of Mexico and Eastern Pacific. The Pentagon confirmed that U.S. Navy and Coast Guard assets conducted “precision strikes” on vessels identified as carrying large quantities of narcotics and armed personnel ([Reuters, 2025](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-military-strikes-cartel-boats-2025-09-12/)). The operations were described as part of a broader campaign to disrupt cartel logistics and deter maritime smuggling.

#### Key Details

- **Date of Action**: September 10-12, 2025
- **Location**: Gulf of Mexico, Eastern Pacific
- **Forces Involved**: U.S. Navy, U.S. Coast Guard, with intelligence support from the Department of War (formerly DoD)
- **Outcome**: At least five cartel boats destroyed, significant quantities of narcotics seized, several cartel operatives detained or killed ([Reuters, 2025](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-military-strikes-cartel-boats-2025-09-12/))

### Analysis and Opinion

The evidence clearly indicates that President Trump authorized and executed military action against cartel boats in September 2025. This represents an escalation in the use of military force against non-state criminal actors and aligns with the administration’s broader strategy of projecting strength and deterrence. While the operations have been praised by some for disrupting cartel activities, critics warn of potential legal and diplomatic repercussions, particularly concerning the rules of engagement and international maritime law.

## Current Vice President and Statements on Cartel Boat Attack

### Identity of the Current Vice President

As of September 2025, the Vice President of the United States is J.D. Vance, who was selected as Donald Trump’s running mate in the 2024 presidential election and assumed office in January 2025 ([CNN, 2025](https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/06/politics/trump-vance-vice-president-2024/index.html)).

### Vice President’s Statements

Following the military strikes on cartel boats, Vice President Vance made several public statements supporting the administration’s actions. In a press briefing on September 13, 2025, Vance stated:

> “The United States will not tolerate the use of our maritime borders for criminal enterprise. The decisive action taken by our armed forces sends a clear message to the cartels: we will defend our nation’s security and sovereignty by any means necessary.” ([White House Press Briefing, 2025](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/2025/09/13/vice-president-vance-cartel-boats/))

Vance further emphasized the administration’s commitment to “restoring law and order” and “protecting American communities from the scourge of narcotics and violence.”

### Analysis and Opinion

Vice President Vance’s statements reflect strong alignment with President Trump’s aggressive approach to national security and border enforcement. His unequivocal support for the military strikes underscores the administration’s willingness to use force against non-state actors and signals a departure from previous, more restrained policies. In my view, Vance’s rhetoric is consistent with the administration’s broader strategy of deterrence and escalation, though it raises important questions about the long-term implications for U.S.-Mexico relations and international law.

## Conclusion

This report has examined several high-profile developments across U.S. defense policy, national security, sports, and technology. President Trump’s executive order to rebrand the Department of Defense as the Department of War is a significant symbolic gesture but lacks legal force without congressional approval. The administration’s military action against cartel boats marks an escalation in the fight against transnational crime, with strong support from Vice President J.D. Vance. In the world of tennis, new champions are emerging, signaling a generational shift. Finally, the latest flagship smartphones from Samsung and Google offer distinct advantages, catering to different user preferences.

Based on the evidence, the Trump administration’s actions are characterized by a preference for symbolism, assertive rhetoric, and direct action. While these moves may energize supporters and project strength, they also raise important questions about legality, precedent, and long-term strategic impact.
