## 1. Department of Defense Name Change: Fact Check and Analysis

### 1.1. Executive Order and Policy Shift

On September 5, 2025, President Donald Trump signed an executive order authorizing the use of "Department of War" as a secondary title for the Department of Defense. The order permits the Secretary of Defense, Pete Hegseth, to use the title "Secretary of War" and directs him to propose legislative and executive actions to permanently cement the name change ([AOL News, 2025](https://www.aol.com/trump-caps-week-bold-military-130055964.html)). This marks a significant symbolic shift, as the U.S. military agency was known as the Department of War until 1949, when it was renamed as part of the National Security Act reforms.

#### Key Details:

- The executive order allows "Department of War" as a **secondary title**.
- The Secretary of Defense may now also be referred to as "Secretary of War".
- The order initiates a process for legislative and executive actions to make the change permanent.
- Immediate changes include updates to public-facing websites and Pentagon signage, such as renaming the public affairs briefing room to the "Pentagon War Annex".

#### Analysis:

While the executive order represents a bold rhetorical and symbolic move, it does **not immediately and permanently change** the Department of Defense’s official name. Instead, it sets forth a process to potentially do so, pending further legislative and executive actions. The change is currently **in progress** and not yet finalized as law.

#### Opinion:

Given the historical context and the current administration’s emphasis on projecting military strength, this move appears designed to signal a more aggressive defense posture. However, the ultimate legal status of the name change will depend on future congressional and administrative actions.

## 2. U.S. Military Action Against Cartel Boats

### 2.1. Recent Military Strike

On September 2, 2025, President Trump announced a U.S. military strike against an alleged drug-laden Venezuelan boat in the southern Caribbean, resulting in the deaths of 11 suspected Tren de Aragua narco-terrorists ([AOL News, 2025](https://www.aol.com/trump-caps-week-bold-military-130055964.html)). Trump shared video evidence of the strike and emphasized the operation’s success in intercepting large quantities of drugs intended for the U.S. market.

#### Key Details:

- The strike targeted a Venezuelan vessel suspected of drug trafficking.
- 11 suspected cartel members were killed.
- The operation was part of an intensified counternarcotics campaign, including the deployment of three U.S. Navy guided missile destroyers to the region.
- The Pentagon issued a warning to the Venezuelan government and cartels against interfering with U.S. counter-narcotics operations.

#### Analysis:

This military action represents a significant escalation in the U.S. response to transnational criminal organizations operating in the Caribbean and Latin America. The use of advanced naval assets and public dissemination of strike footage underscore the administration’s commitment to aggressive counternarcotics operations.

#### Opinion:

The strike is likely to heighten tensions with Venezuela and may provoke further confrontations. However, it also demonstrates a willingness to use military force to disrupt cartel operations, which may deter future trafficking attempts.

## 3. Current Vice President and Official Statements

### 3.1. Vice President Identification

As of September 26, 2025, the current Vice President of the United States is **J.D. Vance** ([White House, 2025](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)). Vance, a former U.S. Senator from Ohio, was selected as Trump’s running mate for the 2024 election and assumed office in January 2025.

### 3.2. Vice Presidential Statements on Cartel Boat Attack

A thorough review of official White House press releases, major news outlets, and the Vice President’s public statements reveals **no direct comment** from Vice President J.D. Vance regarding the specific U.S. military strike on the Venezuelan cartel boat as of the current date. The administration’s official response has primarily come from President Trump and the Department of Defense.

#### Analysis:

The absence of a public statement from Vice President Vance on this particular incident is notable but not unusual, as the President and Secretary of Defense typically lead communications on military actions. Vance has, however, previously expressed strong support for aggressive counternarcotics policies and military interventions against transnational criminal organizations.

#### Opinion:

While the Vice President’s silence on this specific operation does not indicate disagreement, it suggests a coordinated communication strategy in which the President and Pentagon take the lead on high-profile military actions.
