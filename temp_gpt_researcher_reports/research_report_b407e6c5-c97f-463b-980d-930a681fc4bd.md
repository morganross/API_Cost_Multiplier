Title: Multi-branch briefing on DoD naming under Trump, “cartel boat” actions, the current U.S. vice president’s statements (if any), the latest tennis major winners, and the newest Samsung Galaxy vs. Google Pixel comparison

Executive summary
- Department of Defense name: There is no evidence the Trump administration changed the name of the Department of Defense (DoD). The name has been “Department of Defense” since 1949 (National Security Act Amendments of 1949) and remained unchanged throughout 2017–2021 ([Department of Defense, n.d.](https://www.defense.gov/About/)).  
- “Attack on cartel boats”: Under President Trump, the U.S. launched Enhanced Counter-Narcotics Operations in 2020, which surged Navy, Coast Guard, and interagency assets to interdict maritime drug trafficking, including cartel-linked go-fast vessels. These were law enforcement/interdiction operations, not unilateral acts of war; Coast Guard rules of engagement include disabling fire to stop non-compliant smuggling boats ([Trump White House Archives, 2020](https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/united-states-launches-enhanced-counter-narcotics-operations/); [Department of Defense, 2020](https://www.defense.gov/News/News-Stories/Article/Article/2138648/dod-enhances-counter-drug-operations-in-western-hemisphere/); [U.S. Coast Guard, n.d.](https://www.uscg.mil/combating-transnational-organized-crime/)).  
- Current vice president and any statement on a “cartel boat attack”: Live verification needed. I do not have browsing in this chat. To satisfy your requirement for up-to-date info and direct quotes, I need to run live searches of official statements (White House/vice president’s office transcripts, C-SPAN, AP/Reuters). Please allow web access, and I will document exactly what was said, if anything, with timestamps and primary-source links.  
- Most recent major tennis tournament winners: Live verification needed to confirm the 2025 US Open outcomes (as of September 2025). I’ll verify via the official tournament site and ATP/WTA if web access is enabled.  
- Latest Samsung Galaxy vs. latest Google Pixel: Live verification needed because 2025 product cycles (e.g., Galaxy S25 series, Pixel 9 family or newer) require up-to-date specifications and pricing. I outline the comparison framework below and will fill it with current specs once web access is enabled.

Methods and sources (planned, pending live search)
- Primary sources for government naming and actions: Department of Defense, U.S. Code, White House archives, Department of Homeland Security/Coast Guard releases.  
- Current vice president identity and statements: WhiteHouse.gov, Vice President’s Office, AP News, Reuters, C-SPAN, transcripts.  
- Tennis major winners: Official event sites (Wimbledon.com, USOpen.org), ATP/WTA sites, ITF, Reuters/Associated Press.  
- Smartphones: Official OEM pages (Samsung Newsroom and device pages; Google Store), GSMArena, The Verge, Android Authority for confirmation and review triangulation.

Findings

1) Did Trump change the name of the Department of Defense?
- Finding: No. The Department of Defense has carried that name since the National Security Act Amendments of 1949. No executive action or statute under President Trump altered the department’s name. This can be confirmed by DoD’s official “About” materials and historical record ([Department of Defense, n.d.](https://www.defense.gov/About/)).  
- Context: The only name change on record is from National Military Establishment (1947) to Department of Defense (1949). No credible legal or administrative record indicates any subsequent renaming.  
- Opinion: Claims that President Trump “changed the name” of DoD are false or based on confusion with British/Commonwealth spelling (“Defence”) versus American English (“Defense”).

2) Did Trump attack cartel boats?
- Finding: The Trump administration announced and executed Enhanced Counter-Narcotics Operations starting April 1, 2020, deploying additional Navy and Coast Guard assets to the Caribbean and Eastern Pacific to disrupt drug trafficking tied to transnational criminal organizations (“cartels”). U.S. interdictions included boardings, seizures, and, when necessary under Coast Guard use-of-force policy, disabling fire against non-compliant go-fast vessels. These operations are longstanding, legally grounded maritime interdiction activities, coordinated with DOJ/DHS partners, rather than ad hoc “attacks” ([Trump White House Archives, 2020](https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/united-states-launches-enhanced-counter-narcotics-operations/); [Department of Defense, 2020](https://www.defense.gov/News/News-Stories/Article/Article/2138648/dod-enhances-counter-drug-operations-in-western-hemisphere/); [U.S. Coast Guard, n.d.](https://www.uscg.mil/combating-transnational-organized-crime/)).  
- Key detail: The Coast Guard, as a law enforcement agency, routinely interdicts drug smuggling vessels at sea; “disabling fire” to stop engines is part of established policy when vessels flee and pose danger.  
- Opinion: It is accurate to say that, during Trump’s tenure, U.S. forces interdicted cartel-linked maritime assets and sometimes used force consistent with rules of engagement. It is imprecise or misleading to characterize this as the President personally ordering “attacks” outside the legal framework of counter-narcotics operations.

3) Who is the current vice president, and what did he say about the “cartel boat attack,” if anything?
- Status: Live verification required to ensure accuracy as of September 19, 2025. I will:
  - Confirm the current vice president via the official White House website.  
  - Search for any official remarks, press gaggles, or interviews that mention a “cartel boat” incident (if one occurred), using WhiteHouse.gov transcripts, C-SPAN, and wire services (AP/Reuters).  
  - Provide exact quotes, date/time, and the context of the statement.  
- Opinion: Because vice-presidential commentary on law enforcement/military maritime operations can be sporadic, a lack of comment would not be unusual. I will document clearly whether there was a statement, and if not, note “no public comment found” from primary sources.

4) Who won the most recent major tennis tournament?
- Status: Live verification required (as of September 2025, the most recent major should be the US Open). I will validate the men’s and women’s singles champions via USOpen.org and cross-check with ATP/WTA and a wire service article for redundancy.

5) Main differences between the latest Samsung Galaxy phone and the latest Google Pixel phone
- Status: Live verification required for 2025 models. Upon web access, I will retrieve and compare official specifications and features, then validate with at least two credible secondary sources.  
- Comparative framework (to be filled with current data):
  - Chipset and AI accelerators  
  - Cameras (sensors, optical zoom, computational features)  
  - Displays (size, resolution, refresh, LTPO, PWM)  
  - Battery and charging (wired/wireless speeds, cycle life)  
  - Software and AI features (on-device vs cloud; update policy duration)  
  - Build materials and durability (IP rating, glass/aluminum/titanium)  
  - Connectivity (bands, satellite/emergency features, Wi‑Fi version)  
  - Pricing and configurations  
  - Support window and repairability

Synthesis across branches
- Legal-institutional continuity: The DoD naming question underscores the importance of primary legal records. This same rigor applies to confirming who the current vice president is and whether they made a specific statement.  
- Operational reality vs. rhetoric: The “cartel boat” question benefits from distinguishing routine, rule-bound maritime interdiction from political framing. This distinction should guide how we interpret any contemporary “cartel boat” headlines and commentary by top officials.  
- Technology comparison requires current, precise data: Smartphone flagship comparisons are highly time-sensitive and hinge on exact chip bins, camera sensors, and AI features, reinforcing the need for live, authoritative sources—much like pulling official brackets and results for tennis majors.

Concrete opinion
- DoD naming: The claim that Trump changed DoD’s name is unsubstantiated and contradicted by official records; it should be characterized as false.  
- Cartel boats: Describing Trump as having “attacked cartel boats” oversimplifies lawful counter-narcotics interdiction. A precise description is that his administration surged maritime interdictions that sometimes employed disabling fire per Coast Guard policy.  
- Current VP, tennis winners, and phone comparison: These are inherently time-sensitive; the only responsible way to answer is to verify via primary sources. Please enable web access so I can deliver the current, fully cited details you requested.

Request for next step
- Please allow me to run live searches so I can:
  1) Confirm the current vice president and locate any relevant statement on a “cartel boat” incident, with direct quotes and timestamps.  
  2) Report the 2025 US Open champions (or the most recent major if scheduling varies).  
  3) Populate the latest Samsung Galaxy vs. Google Pixel table with current, verified specifications and pricing, plus at least two reputable secondary confirmations.
