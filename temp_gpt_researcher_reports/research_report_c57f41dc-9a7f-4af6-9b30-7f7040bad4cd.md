# Report on Changes to the Entity Over Time  
## National Ocean Service (NOS)

The National Ocean Service (NOS), a key division within the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), has undergone significant changes since its inception, reflecting broader shifts in U.S. coastal and ocean policy, scientific advancements, and organizational restructuring. This report provides a comprehensive analysis of the evolution of NOS, focusing on its structure, mission, priorities, and scope of operations.

## Historical Evolution

The origins of the NOS trace back to 1807 with the establishment of the Survey of the Coast, the first scientific agency of the U.S. government. This early focus was on mapping and charting the nation's coasts to ensure safe navigation. In 1970, a major federal reorganization led to the creation of NOAA, at which point the Coast and Geodetic Survey became part of NOAA’s National Ocean Survey. In 1983, reflecting an expanded mission and diversified responsibilities, the National Ocean Survey was renamed the National Ocean Service ([Wikipedia, 2025](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Ocean_Service); [NGS History, 2020](https://www.ngs.noaa.gov/INFO/history/organizational-milestones.shtml)).

| Year        | Name/Status Change                  | Key Focus/Responsibilities                         |
|-------------|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| 1807        | Survey of the Coast                 | Coastal mapping, navigation safety                 |
| 1970        | National Ocean Survey (NOAA)        | Integrated into NOAA, expanded oceanic scope       |
| 1983        | National Ocean Service (NOS)        | Broader mandate: ecosystems, resilience, science   |

## Organizational Structure and Growth

NOS is one of six major divisions within NOAA, itself part of the U.S. Department of Commerce. Over time, NOS has expanded both in size and scope. As of FY 2012, NOS employed approximately 1,259 staff with a budget of $559.6 million ([Wikipedia, 2025](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Ocean_Service)). More recent figures indicate NOS employs around 1,700 scientists, resource managers, and specialists, highlighting its growth and the increasing complexity of its mission ([Wikipedia, 2025](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Ocean_Service)).

The organizational structure has also evolved, now comprising seven program offices and two staff offices, including:
- Center for Operational Oceanographic Products and Services (CO-OPS)
- National Centers for Coastal Ocean Science (NCCOS)
- Office of Coast Survey (OCS)
- Office for Coastal Management (OCM)
- National Geodetic Survey (NGS)
- Office of National Marine Sanctuaries (ONMS)
- Office of Response and Restoration (OR&R)
- Integrated Ocean Observing System Program (IOOS)

This diversification reflects the NOS’s shift from a primarily mapping and navigation agency to one addressing a broad suite of coastal and oceanic challenges ([Wikipedia, 2025](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Ocean_Service)).

## Mission and Strategic Priorities

The NOS mission has evolved from ensuring safe navigation to providing "science-based solutions through collaborative partnerships to address evolving economic, environmental, and social pressures on our Great Lakes, ocean, and coasts" ([NOAA Ocean Service, 2025](https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/about/)). Its current vision emphasizes thriving, resilient coastal and Great Lakes communities, ecosystems, and economies.

Recent strategic plans (as of July 2023) highlight four overarching priorities:
1. **Increase U.S. Coastal Resilience:** Providing data, tools, and services to help communities assess risks and adapt to environmental changes.
2. **Accelerate Growth of the Ocean Enterprise and Blue Economy:** Supporting sustainable economic development in marine sectors.
3. **Conserve, Restore, and Connect Healthy Coastal and Marine Ecosystems:** Applying science and management to ensure sustainable resource use.
4. **Advance Science and Technology:** Leveraging new technologies and research to inform decision-making ([NOAA Ocean Service, 2025](https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/about/)).

## Expansion of Statutory Authorities

NOS now administers or supports over 20 statutory authorities, including the Clean Water Act, Coastal Zone Management Act, Marine Debris Act, and National Marine Sanctuaries Act. This legal framework underpins its expanded responsibilities in environmental protection, resource management, and disaster response ([NOS Introduction PDF, 2023](https://cdn.oceanservice.noaa.gov/oceanserviceprod/about/introduction-nos.pdf)).

## Programmatic and Technological Advancements

NOS has increasingly adopted advanced surveying, observing, modeling, and computing technologies. For example, the integration of real-time oceanographic and meteorological observation systems (e.g., PORTS® in the Hudson River) demonstrates NOS’s commitment to providing actionable data for navigation safety and coastal management ([NOAA Ocean Service, 2025](https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/)).

NOS’s role in disaster response, habitat restoration, and pollution mitigation has also grown. Initiatives such as the Marine Debris Program and the Office of Response and Restoration highlight NOS’s capacity to address emerging environmental threats and support community resilience ([NOAA Ocean Service, 2025](https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/)).

## Conclusion and Outlook

The National Ocean Service has transformed from a coastal mapping agency to a multifaceted organization at the forefront of coastal science, management, and resilience. Its expanded statutory authority, growing workforce, and adoption of cutting-edge technology underscore its critical role in addressing the nation’s evolving ocean and coastal challenges. The NOS’s trajectory reflects a proactive response to climate change, economic development, and environmental stewardship, positioning it as a cornerstone of U.S. coastal policy and science.
