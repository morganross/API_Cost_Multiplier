# Report on Changes to the Entity Over Time  
## - National Ocean Service (NOS)

The National Ocean Service (NOS), a line office within the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) under the U.S. Department of Commerce, has undergone significant changes since its inception, reflecting evolving national priorities, scientific advancements, and environmental challenges. This report examines the historical evolution, organizational restructuring, and strategic shifts of the NOS, drawing on authoritative and recent sources.

### Historical Evolution and Organizational Changes

The origins of the NOS trace back to the National Ocean Survey, established in 1970, which itself was a successor to earlier federal efforts in ocean and coastal mapping. In 1983, reflecting a broadened mandate beyond surveying, the entity was renamed the National Ocean Service. This change marked a shift from a primary focus on mapping and surveying to a more comprehensive stewardship of the nation’s coastal and oceanic resources ([Wikipedia, 2024](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Ocean_Service)).

Over time, the NOS has expanded its jurisdiction to encompass approximately 95,000 miles of U.S. shoreline and 3.5 million square miles of coastal, Great Lakes, and ocean waters. Its responsibilities have grown to include not only navigation safety and mapping but also ecosystem protection, disaster response, and the provision of scientific data and tools for coastal resilience ([NOAA Ocean Service, 2024](https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/about/)).

### Organizational Structure and Programmatic Expansion

The NOS is currently composed of seven primary program offices and two staff offices, each specializing in key areas such as oceanographic products, coastal management, geodetic surveying, marine sanctuaries, and emergency response. This structure reflects an increasing specialization and diversification in response to complex environmental and societal needs. The major program offices include:

| Program Office                                          | Focus Area                                                      |
|---------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Center for Operational Oceanographic Products & Services | Tides, currents, sea level, and oceanographic data              |
| National Centers for Coastal Ocean Science              | Coastal ecosystem science and research                          |
| Office of Coast Survey                                  | Nautical charting and hydrographic surveys                      |
| Office for Coastal Management                           | Coastal zone management and resilience                          |
| National Geodetic Survey                                | Geodetic data and positioning                                   |
| Office of National Marine Sanctuaries                   | Marine protected areas management                               |
| Office of Response and Restoration                      | Emergency response to oil/chemical spills, restoration efforts  |

### Strategic Shifts and Recent Priorities

The NOS has consistently updated its strategic direction to address emerging challenges. The most recent NOS Strategic Plan (2024–2028) underscores four overarching priorities:

1. **Increase U.S. Coastal Resilience:** Enhancing predictive capabilities and supporting community-specific needs to address climate change, sea-level rise, and coastal hazards.
2. **Make Equity Central to the Mission:** Ensuring equitable access to NOS data, products, and services while fostering a diverse and inclusive workforce.
3. **Accelerate Growth of the Ocean Enterprise and the Blue Economy:** Leveraging ocean, coastal, and Great Lakes data to support innovation, economic growth, and sustainable use of marine resources.
4. **Conserve, Restore, and Connect Healthy Coastal and Marine Ecosystems:** Applying scientific understanding and resource management to restore degraded ecosystems and promote sustainable use ([NOS Strategic Plan, 2023](https://content.govdelivery.com/accounts/USNOAANOS/bulletins/3780776)).

These priorities reflect a shift from traditional resource management to a more integrated approach that balances economic, environmental, and social objectives, with a strong emphasis on climate resilience and equity.

### Scientific and Technological Advancements

The NOS has increasingly relied on advanced technologies and integrated data systems, such as the Integrated Ocean Observing System (IOOS), to provide real-time data for navigation, disaster response, and ecosystem monitoring. This technological evolution has enabled the NOS to fill critical data gaps, improve forecasting, and support decision-making at local, regional, and national levels ([NOS Overview PDF, 2024](https://cdn.oceanservice.noaa.gov/oceanserviceprod/about/nos_story_final.pdf)).

### Budget and Workforce Trends

The NOS workforce has grown to approximately 1,700 scientists, resource managers, and specialists, reflecting the expanding scope of its mission. The annual budget has also increased over time, with reported figures of $559.6 million in FY 2012, supporting a wide array of programs and initiatives ([Wikipedia, 2024](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Ocean_Service)).

### Conclusion and Outlook

The National Ocean Service has transformed from a surveying agency into a multifaceted organization at the forefront of ocean and coastal science, management, and resilience. Its evolution mirrors the growing complexity of environmental challenges facing the United States, particularly in the context of climate change, coastal development, and the need for sustainable economic growth. The NOS’s current strategic focus on resilience, equity, innovation, and ecosystem health positions it as a critical player in safeguarding the nation’s coastal and oceanic future.
