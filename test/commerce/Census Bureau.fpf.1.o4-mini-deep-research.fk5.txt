## Renaming of the Department of Defense  
Yes. In early September 2025 President Trump signed an executive order to symbolically rename the U.S. Department of Defense as the “Department of War.” News reports confirm that Trump ordered the change for all executive communications, restoring the historic name last used in the 1940s ([www.aljazeera.com](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/9/5/trump-symbolically-changes-department-of-defense-to-department-of-war#:~:text=United%20States%20President%20Donald%20Trump,War%20in%20all%20executive%20statements)) ([www.cbsnews.com](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-department-of-war-defense/#:~:text=Washington%20%E2%80%94%20President%20Trump%20signed,held%20in%20the%20late%201940s)).  (The order allows the DoD to use “Department of War” as a secondary title and even lets the Defense Secretary be called “Secretary of War,” though Congress would still have to approve any permanent name change ([www.cbsnews.com](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-department-of-war-defense/#:~:text=Washington%20%E2%80%94%20President%20Trump%20signed,held%20in%20the%20late%201940s)).) 

## Attacks on Suspected Drug-Smuggling Boats  
Yes. The Trump administration has indeed carried out military strikes on boats suspected of drug trafficking. In September 2025 U.S. forces bombed at least one fast boat moving drugs from Venezuela, killing the suspected smugglers on board ([www.aljazeera.com](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/9/3/trump-says-11-killed-in-strike-on-alleged-drug-carrying-boat-from-venezuela#:~:text=President%20Donald%20Trump%20has%20announced,the%20Tren%20de%20Aragua%20gang)) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/trump-defends-us-strike-boat-venezuela-he-says-was-carrying-drugs-2025-09-03/#:~:text=On%20September%203%2C%202025%2C%20U,the%20Oval%20Office%2C%20reiterating%20his)).  The White House called these “kinetic strikes” against narco-terror boats.  For example, on Sept. 2 Trump announced a strike that killed 11 alleged traffickers, and on Sept. 15 he announced another strike that killed 3 more aboard a suspected cocaine/fentanyl boat in international waters ([www.aljazeera.com](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/9/3/trump-says-11-killed-in-strike-on-alleged-drug-carrying-boat-from-venezuela#:~:text=President%20Donald%20Trump%20has%20announced,the%20Tren%20de%20Aragua%20gang)) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/trump-says-us-struck-another-alleged-venezuelan-drug-vessel-killing-three-2025-09-15/#:~:text=On%20September%2015%2C%202025%2C%20President,similar%20September%202%20strike%2C%20which)).  These actions, described as part of a new “war on cartels,” have drawn scrutiny but followed Trump’s public stamp of approval ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/trump-defends-us-strike-boat-venezuela-he-says-was-carrying-drugs-2025-09-03/#:~:text=On%20September%203%2C%202025%2C%20U,the%20Oval%20Office%2C%20reiterating%20his)) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/trump-says-us-struck-another-alleged-venezuelan-drug-vessel-killing-three-2025-09-15/#:~:text=On%20September%2015%2C%202025%2C%20President,similar%20September%202%20strike%2C%20which)). 

## Current U.S. Vice President and His Remarks on the Boat Strikes  
The current U.S. Vice President (under Trump’s 2025 administration) is Senator J.D. Vance ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/jd-vance-once-compared-trump-hitler-now-they-are-running-mates-2024-07-15/#:~:text=JD%20Vance%2C%20author%20of%20the,senator%20from%20Ohio%20and%20gained)).  Vance has strongly defended the strikes.  For example, after critics raised legal concerns, Vance posted on social media that **he “doesn’t give a s— what you call it”** when it comes to accusations of war crimes over the attack ([indianexpress.com](https://indianexpress.com/article/world/dont-give-a-sht-jd-vance-defends-us-airstrike-on-venezuelan-drug-boat-11-dead-10235697/#:~:text=about%20America%E2%80%99s%20use%20of%20military,t%20what%20you%20call%20it.%E2%80%9D)).  He also wrote on X (formerly Twitter) that “killing cartel members who poison our fellow citizens is the highest and best use of our military” ([indianexpress.com](https://indianexpress.com/article/world/dont-give-a-sht-jd-vance-defends-us-airstrike-on-venezuelan-drug-boat-11-dead-10235697/#:~:text=suspected%20traffickers%20were%20killed,foreign%20civilians%20without%20due%20process)).  In other words, Vance publicly endorsed the use of U.S. force against the drug boat, dismissing opponents’ objections as meaningless.  (There are no known public comments from Vice President Vance explicitly condemning the strike.)  

## Most Recent Grand Slam Tennis Champions  
As of the latest Grand Slam (the 2025 U.S. Open), the men’s and women’s singles champions were **Carlos Alcaraz** (men’s) and **Aryna Sabalenka** (women’s).  Alcaraz of Spain defeated Jannik Sinner in the US Open 2025 final (6-2, 3-6, 6-1, 6-4) to claim his second U.S. Open title ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/sports/tennis/alcaraz-beats-sinner-win-us-open-title-2025-09-07/#:~:text=Spain%27s%20Carlos%20Alcaraz%20won%20the,top%20players%20in%20men%27s%20tennis)).  Aryna Sabalenka of Belarus won the 2025 U.S. Open women’s final (6-3, 7-6) over Amanda Anisimova, becoming the first woman since Serena Williams to defend the U.S. Open title ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/sports/tennis/list-us-open-womens-singles-champions-2025-09-06/#:~:text=winners%2C%20runners,in%202024%2C%20beating%20Jessica%20Pegula)).  (By comparison, at Wimbledon 2025 the men’s champion was Jannik Sinner over Carlos Alcaraz ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/sports/tennis/sinner-beats-alcaraz-win-wimbledon-mens-title-2025-07-13/#:~:text=Italy%27s%20Jannik%20Sinner%2C%20the%20world,dominance%20in%20the%20tennis%20world)), and the women’s champion was Iga Świątek ([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/dfd0e0b0abe53ab43383e9718f562ef2#:~:text=Iga%20Swiatek%20won%20her%20first,in%20and%20strong%20baseline%20play)), but the US Open is the more recent Grand Slam.) 

## Latest Samsung Galaxy vs. Google Pixel – Key Differences  
The newest Samsung Galaxy flagship (Galaxy S25 series, released early 2025) and the newest Google Pixel (Pixel 9 series, launched Aug–Sept 2024) differ in hardware and software: 

- **Chipset and performance:** Samsung’s Galaxy S25 uses Qualcomm’s latest Snapdragon 8 Elite chip, which on paper outperforms Google’s Tensor G4 processor in the Pixel 9 ([www.digitaltrends.com](https://www.digitaltrends.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-vs-google-pixel-9/#:~:text=Processor%20%20,facing%2010.5MP%20selfie)).  This means the S25 tends to run faster in heavy tasks (gaming, video editing, etc.), while the Pixel 9 handles everyday use smoothly but is generally lower-powered.  

- **Camera systems:** The Galaxy S25 has a **triple rear camera** (50 MP main + 12 MP ultra-wide + 10 MP telephoto) and a 12 MP front camera ([www.digitaltrends.com](https://www.digitaltrends.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-vs-google-pixel-9/#:~:text=Porcelain%20Camera%20%20%7C%20Rear,facing%2010.5MP%20selfie)).  The Pixel 9 has a **dual rear camera** (50 MP main + 48 MP ultra-wide) and a 10.5 MP front camera ([www.digitaltrends.com](https://www.digitaltrends.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-vs-google-pixel-9/#:~:text=Porcelain%20Camera%20%20%7C%20Rear,facing%2010.5MP%20selfie)).  In practice, Samsung adds a dedicated 3× telephoto lens, whereas Google relies on computational photography and a higher-resolution ultra-wide. Google’s Pixel line is known for strong image processing, but it lacks an optical telephoto on the base Pixel 9.  

- **Display:** Both phones use ~6.2–6.3 inch OLED screens at 120 Hz. The S25’s is a Dynamic AMOLED 2X (6.2″, 1080×2340) while the Pixel 9 has a 6.3″ OLED “Actua” display (1080×2424) ([www.digitaltrends.com](https://www.digitaltrends.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-vs-google-pixel-9/#:~:text=,120Hz%20dynamic%20refresh%20rate)). The Pixel panel is noted for its extremely high peak brightness (up to ~1800 nits HDR, 2700 nits peak) as listed in specs ([www.digitaltrends.com](https://www.digitaltrends.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-vs-google-pixel-9/#:~:text=,120Hz%20dynamic%20refresh%20rate)).  Samsung’s screen is also bright with vibrant colors. Both displays support smooth 120 Hz refresh, but Google emphasizes HDR/brightness, whereas Samsung offers its usual One UI display tuning and Galaxy AI features on top of Android.  

- **Battery and charging:** The Pixel 9 packs a larger 4700 mAh battery versus 4000 mAh in the Galaxy S25 ([www.digitaltrends.com](https://www.digitaltrends.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-vs-google-pixel-9/#:~:text=facing%3A%2012MP%20selfie%20%20,27W%20wired%2015W)). In tests and reports this gives the Pixel 9 noticeably longer battery life, even though charging speeds are similar (Samsung: 25 W wired; Google: 27 W wired) ([www.digitaltrends.com](https://www.digitaltrends.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-vs-google-pixel-9/#:~:text=facing%3A%2012MP%20selfie%20%20,27W%20wired%2015W)). Both support wireless charging and reverse wireless charging. 

- **Software:** Both run Android 15, but Samsung’s S25 uses Samsung’s One UI 7 (with Galaxy AI features and more customization), whereas the Pixel 9 uses “stock” Android with Google’s AI enhancements (including integrated Gemini AI features). Samsung adds extra apps and settings (bloatware by some standards), while Pixel offers a cleaner interface with earlier software updates. 

- **Design and price:** The Galaxy S25 and Pixel 9 are similarly sized (around 6.1–6.3″) and start at roughly the same base price (~$800) ([www.digitaltrends.com](https://www.digitaltrends.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-vs-google-pixel-9/#:~:text=facing%3A%2012MP%20selfie%20%20,27W%20wired%2015W)). Samsung offers different color options (Icyblue, Navy, etc.) and a rounded-glass design, while Google’s Pixel 9 comes in unique finishes (Peony, Wintergreen, Obsidian, etc.) and a flatter metal frame. Each has its own aesthetic appeal. 

Overall, the S25 emphasizes raw power and a versatile camera system, while the Pixel 9 emphasizes battery life, high display brightness, and Google’s AI-enhanced imaging.
