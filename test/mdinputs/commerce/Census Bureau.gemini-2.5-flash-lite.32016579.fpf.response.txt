## Government Shutdown Extends Into Second Week Amid Congressional Stalemate

**Washington D.C.** - The federal government shutdown has entered its second week with no immediate resolution in sight as Congress remains deadlocked over a spending deal. The shutdown, which began at 12:01 a.m. on October 1, 2025, has led to the furlough of hundreds of thousands of federal employees and is beginning to impact various government services.

The central point of contention is a disagreement between Democrats and Republicans over the extension of health care subsidies. Democrats are insisting on including an extension of these subsidies in any funding bill, a demand that Republicans have so far rejected. This impasse has resulted in the Senate failing to pass multiple procedural votes to advance competing funding bills from both parties. The Senate has adjourned until the following week, ensuring the shutdown will continue.

As a result of the shutdown, an estimated 900,000 federal employees have been furloughed. Furthermore, the Trump administration has initiated layoffs, with over 4,000 workers at seven federal agencies potentially receiving notices. Federal employees began receiving layoff notices, a move that goes beyond the typical furloughs seen in previous shutdowns. While essential federal employees, such as air traffic controllers and law enforcement, are required to work, they will not receive pay until the shutdown ends.

The shutdown's impact is being felt across various sectors. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has furloughed a significant portion of its staff and has largely ceased operations, which could affect the upcoming tax filing season. Air travel has also been affected, with some flight delays being attributed to shortages of air traffic controllers.

The House of Representatives passed a Republican-backed funding measure on September 19th, but it has been unable to overcome a filibuster in the Senate. House Speaker Mike Johnson has stated that the House will not return to session until the Senate passes a funding bill.

President Trump has stated he is directing the Pentagon to use available funds to ensure military members are paid on time. Meanwhile, both parties continue to blame each other for the shutdown, with no clear path to a resolution yet emerging. The last major government shutdown occurred from December 2018 to January 2019.
