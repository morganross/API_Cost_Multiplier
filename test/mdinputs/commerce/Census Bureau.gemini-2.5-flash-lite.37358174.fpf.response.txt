### Government Shutdown Extends Into Next Week Amid Stalemate and Mass Firings

**Washington D.C.** - The federal government has been in a shutdown since October 1, 2025, and is poised to continue into the following week as the Senate remains deadlocked over a funding agreement. The legislative body adjourned on Thursday without passing a measure to reopen government agencies, ensuring the shutdown will persist.

The central point of contention between Democrats and Republicans is the inclusion of an extension for health care subsidies in the funding bill. Democrats are insisting on this provision, while the Republican-backed bill, which has already passed the House, does not include it. The Senate has failed to advance competing proposals from both parties.

In a move to increase pressure on Democrats, the White House has initiated mass firings of federal workers. The Office of Management and Budget confirmed that "reduction-in-force" (RIF) plans have begun. This aggressive tactic goes beyond the typical furloughs seen in previous shutdowns. Notices have reportedly been issued at various agencies, including the Departments of Education, Health and Human Services, and the Treasury.

The shutdown's impact is being felt across the country. Federal employees began missing their full paychecks on Friday, and there are growing concerns that members of the military may miss their next paycheck, expected on October 15. The aviation sector has also experienced disruptions, with flight delays at several U.S. airports attributed to a shortage of air traffic controllers, who are deemed essential and are working without pay.

While essential federal employees are required to work without pay, they are legally entitled to back pay once the shutdown concludes. However, the Trump administration has raised the possibility of not paying certain furloughed federal employees, a move that opponents argue would be illegal.

House Speaker Mike Johnson has stated that the House, which passed its funding measure on September 19, will not hold further votes until the Senate passes a bill. The Senate is scheduled to reconvene next week, but with both sides entrenched in their positions, there is no clear end in sight for the shutdown.
