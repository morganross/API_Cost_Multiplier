## Government Shutdown Continues as Stalemate in Washington Persists

**Washington D.C.** - The federal government remains in a partial shutdown with no immediate resolution in sight, as the Senate adjourned for the week without a deal to fund government operations. The shutdown, which began at midnight on September 30, 2025, will extend into the next week, marking more than ten days of lapsed funding.

The central point of contention remains a stalemate between Democrats and Republicans over healthcare provisions within the proposed spending bills. The Senate has failed to advance competing proposals from both parties, with the most recent votes on Thursday showing no break in the deadlock.

The impact of the shutdown is escalating. Friday marked the first day that federal workers missed their full paychecks. Furthermore, layoff notices, referred to as "reduction-in-force" or RIFs, have begun to be issued to federal employees in various agencies, including the Departments of Commerce, Education, and Energy. More than 4,000 workers across seven agencies could receive these notices.

The shutdown is also poised to affect the nation's military. Service members are expected to miss their upcoming paycheck on October 15th if the impasse is not resolved. In response, the President has stated his intention to use his authority to direct the Pentagon to utilize available funds to ensure troops are paid.

While the Senate is not expected to reconvene until Tuesday, the House of Representatives has been out of session since passing a Republican funding measure on September 19th. The White House has criticized Democrats for blocking a "clean" continuing resolution to fund the government.

The ongoing shutdown is causing disruptions across various sectors. The travel industry has seen flight delays at several U.S. airports due to shortages of air traffic controllers, who are considered essential workers but are not being paid. While essential services continue, many government operations are significantly reduced, and non-essential employees have been furloughed.

Experts have noted the significant economic costs associated with government shutdowns, not only from the direct cessation of services but also from the uncertainty and preparation for such events. For federal workers, the shutdown brings personal financial strain and a blow to morale. Social Security and Supplemental Security Income (SSI) payments, however, are expected to continue.
