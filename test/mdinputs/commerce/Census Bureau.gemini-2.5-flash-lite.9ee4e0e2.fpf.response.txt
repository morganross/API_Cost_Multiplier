### Government Shutdown Continues Amidst Congressional Stalemate

**Washington D.C.** - The federal government remains in a partial shutdown that commenced at 12:01 a.m. on October 1, 2025, after lawmakers failed to pass a short-term spending bill. The shutdown has entered its 11th day with no immediate resolution in sight as the Senate adjourned for the week without breaking the impasse.

The primary point of contention revolves around healthcare provisions, with Democrats and Republicans unable to agree on the terms of a funding bill. The Senate has repeatedly failed to advance competing spending bills from both parties, with the most recent votes showing a continued deadlock. The House of Representatives had previously passed a Republican-backed funding measure on September 19, but it has been consistently rejected in the Senate.

The shutdown has had a significant impact on federal employees and government operations. The Trump administration has begun issuing reduction-in-force (RIF) notices, indicating potential layoffs for thousands of federal workers. According to a court filing, over 4,000 employees across seven agencies, including the Departments of Commerce, Education, and Energy, were slated to receive these notices. However, some layoff notices issued to CDC employees were reportedly rescinded.

While essential services continue, the shutdown has led to disruptions. Some U.S. airports have experienced flight delays due to shortages of air traffic controllers, who are required to work without pay. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has furloughed nearly half of its workforce, which could lead to delays in refund processing and customer service. It is important to note that tax filing deadlines remain unchanged.

Furloughed federal employees, estimated to be around 737,000, are guaranteed back pay once the shutdown ends under the Government Employee Fair Treatment Act of 2019. However, this guarantee does not extend to employees of federal contractors. In an effort to mitigate the impact on the armed forces, President Trump has directed the Pentagon to use "all available funds" to ensure military personnel are paid.

Negotiations to end the shutdown have shown little progress. The Senate is not expected to hold any further votes on the matter until they return on the following Tuesday, extending the shutdown into the next week.
