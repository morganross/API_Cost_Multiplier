## Government Shutdown Extends Into Next Week Amid Political Stalemate

**Washington D.C.** - The United States federal government has been in a shutdown since midnight on September 30, 2025, after Congress failed to pass the necessary appropriations bills to fund government operations. The shutdown is set to extend into the following week as the Senate adjourned on Thursday without reaching a resolution.

The primary cause of the shutdown is a deadlock between Democrats and Republicans over a spending plan. Disagreements persist on key issues, including the extension of health care subsidies. Both parties are blaming each other for the impasse.

As of October 11, 2025, the government has been shut down for 11 days. The Senate has rejected multiple competing bills from both parties aimed at reopening the government and is not expected to hold further votes until Tuesday.

The shutdown has had a significant impact on federal employees and government services. The Trump administration has initiated layoffs, referred to as "reductions in force" (RIFs), affecting thousands of federal workers across various agencies, including the Departments of Education, Health and Human Services, Commerce, and Energy. This move is seen as an attempt to pressure Democratic lawmakers.

Federal employees began receiving notices of potential layoffs, and many have already missed a paycheck. While it is anticipated that federal workers will receive back pay once the shutdown concludes, the financial strain on them is a growing concern.

The shutdown is also affecting the public. Flight delays have been reported at several U.S. airports due to shortages of air traffic controllers, who are considered essential workers but are not being paid. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has furloughed nearly half of its workforce, leading to expectations of longer wait times for taxpayers and potential ramifications for the 2026 filing season. However, the IRS has not extended the October 15 deadline for taxpayers who filed for an extension on their 2024 federal income taxes.

President Trump has stated that he will use his authority to ensure military members are paid on October 15, despite the shutdown.

The current shutdown is the first since the 35-day shutdown in 2018-2019. The economic cost of such shutdowns can be substantial, with the 2018 closure estimated to have had a $3 billion long-term impact on the economy.
