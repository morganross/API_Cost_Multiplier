**Washington D.C.** - The United States federal government has entered its second week of a shutdown that began at 12:01 a.m. on October 1, 2025, after Congress failed to pass the necessary appropriations legislation for the 2026 fiscal year. The shutdown has led to the furlough of approximately 900,000 federal employees and has left another 700,000 working without pay.

The legislative stalemate continues with no immediate resolution in sight. The Senate has adjourned until the upcoming Tuesday after both Republican and Democratic-backed spending bills failed to secure the 60 votes needed for passage on multiple occasions. A key point of contention is the Democratic push to make permanent the enhanced tax credits for health insurance purchased through the Affordable Care Act marketplaces, a measure Republicans have opposed in the short-term funding proposals.

The economic and social impacts of the shutdown are becoming increasingly apparent. On Friday, October 10th, federal workers missed their first full paychecks. Members of the military are also expected to miss their upcoming paycheck on October 15th, although President Donald Trump has announced his intention to use his authority to ensure they are paid.

Furthermore, the Trump administration has begun issuing layoff notices to over 4,000 federal workers across several agencies, including the Departments of Commerce, Education, and Energy. However, some layoff notices issued to employees at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have reportedly been rescinded.

The shutdown is also affecting public services. Several U.S. airports have experienced flight delays this week due to a shortage of air traffic controllers, who are considered essential employees and are working without pay. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has also significantly curtailed its operations, which could lead to delays in refund processing and customer service.

This marks the third government shutdown under President Trump. Tensions are escalating in Washington, with reports of verbal confrontations between lawmakers as both parties continue to blame each other for the impasse. House Speaker Mike Johnson and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer remain central figures in the ongoing negotiations. As the shutdown extends, various industries have urged Congress to reopen the government to avoid further disruption to the economy and national security.
