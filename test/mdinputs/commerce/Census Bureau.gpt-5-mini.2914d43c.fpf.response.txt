Quick update — U.S. federal government shutdown (as of Oct 12, 2025)

- What’s happening now: The federal government has been shut down since 12:01 a.m. EDT on Oct. 1, 2025 after Congress failed to pass stopgap funding; Senate votes on competing continuing resolutions have repeatedly failed.

- Scale & workforce impact: The Congressional Budget Office estimated roughly 750,000 employees could be furloughed each day (about $400M/day); hundreds of thousands are already off or working without pay. The Office of Management and Budget says reduction‑in‑force (RIF) actions “have begun,” and the administration told a court that about 4,200 employees across several agencies received RIF notices (numbers remain fluid).

- Major service disruptions today: The IRS has “shuttered most operations” and issued furloughs; the Smithsonian museums and National Zoo were expected to close to the public starting Oct. 12 if the lapse continued; many national parks are operating with reduced staff and Yosemite has reported illegal/dangerous activity amid limited enforcement.

- Military pay: President Trump directed the Defense Department to use available/unobligated funds to make military paychecks on Oct. 15 despite the shutdown. ([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/8601ea092fe746cc35b88076e70c4598?utm_source=openai))

- Legal & political developments: Federal unions (AFSCME, AFGE and others) have filed lawsuits seeking to block mass firings and won motions to seek emergency relief; a court hearing on the administration’s layoffs is scheduled for Oct. 15. Congressional negotiations remain stalled.

- What to watch next (short): the Oct. 15 court hearing on RIFs; any new Senate votes or a short-term continuing resolution; further agency RIF/furlough notices and whether Pentagon funding for pay is extended beyond Oct. 15.

Bottom line: As of Oct. 12, 2025 the shutdown continues, negotiations are deadlocked, and the situation is moving from furloughs to targeted layoffs in some agencies — producing growing disruptions (IRS service, museums, some parks) while essential national‑security and mandatory programs remain largely intact.

If you’d like, I can (a) send hourly updates today, (b) pull agency‑specific impacts (IRS, VA, TSA, NIH, parks), or (c) summarize the Oct. 15 court filing and schedule in one paragraph. Which would you prefer?
