Status report — U.S. federal government shutdown (as of Oct 12, 2025)

Bottom line
- The federal government has been shut down since 12:01 a.m. EDT on Oct 1, 2025, and the funding lapse remains in effect. ([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/8601ea092fe746cc35b88076e70c4598?utm_source=openai))

Key developments
- Congressional impasse: multiple Senate votes to advance short-term funding have failed (Senate cannot clear filibusters/reach 60 votes); Democrats are holding out for extensions of Affordable Care Act premium tax credits and related health-care changes, Republicans insist the government reopen first.

- Military pay: President Trump directed the Pentagon to use “all available funds” so service members will be paid on Oct 15; the administration says roughly $8 billion in unobligated R&D funds could be tapped as a short‑term fix. It is not a long‑term legislative solution. ([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/8601ea092fe746cc35b88076e70c4598?utm_source=openai))
- Layoffs / RIFs: The Office of Management and Budget signaled reductions‑in‑force and late court filings said RIF notices began (roughly 4,200 employees initially reported), drawing legal challenges from unions; a hearing on the legality of the layoffs is scheduled for Oct 15.

- Scale & impact: The Congressional Budget Office estimated roughly 750,000 federal employees could be furloughed on a given day of a lapse (≈$400M in compensation per day); many agencies have curtailed operations and some programs (public‑health research, certain administrative services, parts of IRS operations, park services, etc.) are affected.

What to watch (near term)
- Oct 15, 2025: scheduled court hearing over the administration’s RIF notices and (separately) the date service members are to be paid under the Pentagon directive.

- Any new Senate votes or bipartisan negotiating overtures; a “military‑pay” administrative move may reduce short‑term pressure on lawmakers to vote.

- Further agency announcements about additional RIFs, funding freezes (some agency actions already reported), or changes to back‑pay positions from OMB/White House.
