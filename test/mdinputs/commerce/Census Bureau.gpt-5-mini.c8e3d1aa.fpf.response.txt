Short briefing — latest on the U.S. federal government shutdown (as of October 12, 2025)

Status
- Federal funding lapsed at 12:01 a.m. EDT on October 1, 2025; the government has been shut since then. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-says-his-administration-identified-funds-pay-troops-during-shutdown-2025-10-11/?utm_source=openai))

Politics / talks
- The Senate has repeatedly failed to advance competing stopgap bills (multiple procedural votes failed, e.g., 54–45 on the GOP measure), and leaders remain deadlocked over demands about ACA premium tax‑credit extensions and rescissions.

- House Republicans passed a short-term measure but the Senate lacks 60 votes to move it; Speaker Mike Johnson has kept the House in recess (extended into mid/late October) to press the Senate.

Scope and immediate impacts
- Nonpartisan CBO estimated roughly 750,000 federal workers could be furloughed on any given day of a lapse (about $400 million in wages per workday); actual numbers vary by agency and day.

- The IRS announced furloughs of roughly 34,000 employees (about half its staff), pausing many taxpayer services. ([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/952b84666a5099547546af9ee44d883f?utm_source=openai))  
- The administration (OMB) has begun issuing reduction‑in‑force (RIF) layoff notices; unions have sued to block mass firings and a federal judge is hearing related challenges.

Notable developments
- The White House says the Pentagon will tap unobligated defense R&D funds (about $8 billion) to make sure active‑duty service members are paid on October 15 if the shutdown continues. Legal and procedural questions remain. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-says-his-administration-identified-funds-pay-troops-during-shutdown-2025-10-11/?utm_source=openai))  
- Public‑health and research operations are being disrupted: reports of mass layoff notices at the CDC and curtailed NIH/other HHS activities have raised concerns about disease‑surveillance and research continuity. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/trump-administration-lays-off-dozens-cdc-officials-nyt-reports-2025-10-11/?utm_source=openai))  
- Air travel: FAA staffing shortfalls and controller absences have caused delays and temporary facility disruptions at multiple airports (Burbank, Newark, Nashville, Chicago, Denver, etc.). Travelers should expect continued delays. ([nbcmiami.com](https://www.nbcmiami.com/news/national-international/airport-delays-expected-third-day-government-shutdown/3703120/?utm_source=openai))  
- Nutrition support: WIC program funding at the state level is under strain (some states warn funds could run out in weeks unless Congress acts). ([kjzz.org](https://www.kjzz.org/politics/2025-10-09/wic-nutrition-aid-funds-for-arizona-mothers-children-could-run-out-in-3-weeks?utm_source=openai))

What to watch next (near term)
- Senate calendar: when/if the Senate takes another procedural vote (next chance when they reconvene) and whether any bipartisan compromise emerges.

- Court rulings on union challenges to RIF/layoff notices (hearings set in mid‑October). ([afscme.org](https://www.afscme.org/press/releases/2025/unions-file-temporary-restraining-order-to-block-trump-administrations-threatened-mass-firings-of-federal-workers?utm_source=openai))  
- Whether the Pentagon action on troop pay proceeds on Oct. 15 and whether similar measures will be extended beyond that date. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-says-his-administration-identified-funds-pay-troops-during-shutdown-2025-10-11/?utm_source=openai))

If you want, I can: (a) pull the latest Senate calendar/vote schedule for the coming days, (b) assemble agency‑by‑agency service impacts (IRS, FAA, HHS, NOAA, etc.), or (c) produce a one‑page timeline of events since Sept. 30. Which would you prefer?
