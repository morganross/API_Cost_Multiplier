Latest update on the U.S. government shutdown (as of Oct 12, 2025)

- What happened and current status
  - The partial government shutdown began on Oct 1, 2025 at 12:01 a.m. ET after Congress failed to pass funding for FY 2026. As of Oct 12, the shutdown remains in effect with many nonessential operations paused while essential functions continue.

- Pay for U.S. troops
  - On Oct 11, 2025, President Trump said the Defense Department would use “all available funds” to ensure U.S. troops are paid on Oct 15, using about $8 billion in unobligated research and development funds from the prior year. This is a temporary fix and does not address civilian pay. ([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/8601ea092fe746cc35b88076e70c4598?utm_source=openai))

- Federal workforce impact
  - The shutdown has triggered widespread furloughs and laid-off personnel. Agency contingency plans show hundreds of thousands of workers affected; reports indicate mass layoffs at the CDC and large-scale furloughs across HHS, Education, EPA, Treasury, and other agencies. Estimates vary, with some analyses projecting up to roughly 750,000–900,000 federal workers could be affected in total, depending on duration.

- Agencies and services most affected
  - Health and human services agencies (CDC, NIH, FDA, etc.) are among the most affected, with tens of thousands to tens of thousands furloughed or facing layoffs. Other departments (Education, EPA, Treasury, Housing, etc.) are implementing broad contingency measures. Some functions deemed essential (e.g., certain public health activities, safety oversight) continue at reduced capacity.

- What’s happening with travel and safety
  - Transportation and aviation operations continue in a limited fashion under contingency plans, but air travel and related safety oversight may experience disruption if the stalemate persists. Travelers and industry groups are watching closely for changes. ([cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/01/government-shutdown-trump-live-updates.html?utm_source=openai))

- What happens next
  - No final funding agreement has been reached as of Oct 12. Resolution will require Congress to pass a funding measure (short-term or full-year) and for the President to sign. Watch for new Congressional votes or negotiated CRs. The White House maintains a live “Government Shutdown Clock” and updates.
