Latest Update: U.S. government shutdown status (as of Oct 12, 2025)

- What happened and when: The federal government entered a shutdown on Oct 1, 2025 after Congress failed to pass appropriations for the 2026 fiscal year. The impasse centers on spending levels and health-insurance subsidies. ([washingtonpost.com](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/10/01/president-donald-trump-government-shutdown/1d6549e6-9ec1-11f0-af12-ae28224a8694_story.html/))

- Overall impact on federal workers: Estimates vary, but the nonpartisan CBO projects about 750,000 federal employees could be furloughed per day if the lapse continues. By mid-October, hundreds of thousands have been affected with many agencies operating under partial constraints.

- IRS operations: IRS has shuttered most non-essential operations; a large share of employees are furloughed, with about half of staff expected to remain on some duty depending on contingency plans. The agency warned of backlogs and delays.

- Health and public-health agencies (CDC, etc.): Reuters reported mass layoffs at the CDC targeting non-essential units, with about 1,300 notices issued, though some were reversed within hours. The broader health-agency downsizing is part of the shutdown’s non-essential staffing cuts.

- Military pay actions: On Oct 11, President Trump directed the Defense Department to use unobligated funds (about $8 billion) to ensure that U.S. troops are paid on Oct 15. The plan does not clearly cover the Coast Guard, which remains in DHS’ control. Pay beyond Oct 15 remains uncertain. ([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/8601ea092fe746cc35b88076e70c4598))

- Social Security, VA, and other entitlements: Social Security payments are expected to continue on time, though some non-core services may be affected. VA benefits and health care operations are largely maintained (though some offices and services are limited). 97% of VA staff are anticipated to stay on duty according to VA contingency planning.

- Where things stand for key agencies: The shutdown persists into its second week; negotiations in Congress have not yielded a funding bill. Some units have seen targeted furloughs or partial operations, with back-pay questions looming. ([washingtonpost.com](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/10/01/president-donald-trump-government-shutdown/1d6549e6-9ec1-11f0-af12-ae28224a8694_story.html/))

- What to monitor next: For workers and families, watch for any new short- or long-term funding measures (CRs or a full-year bill), updates on back-pay guidance, and any additional moves to fund military pay beyond Oct 15.
