Latest update (as of Oct 12, 2025)

- Status of the shutdown: A partial federal government shutdown began on Oct 1, 2025 (12:01 a.m. ET) after Congress failed to pass funding for FY 2026. The shutdown is ongoing, with essential services continuing but many agencies hampered or closed for nonessential operations.

- How many affected (range reflects varying agency plans): The Congressional Budget Office warned a shutdown could furlough roughly 750,000 federal workers per day, with about $400 million in daily lost pay; actual counts vary by day and agency. By Oct 10–12, hundreds of thousands had been furloughed or affected; for example, the CDC saw about 1,300 layoff notices (some later reversed in part).

- Notable agency actions and effects:
  - CDC: Initial mass layoff notices affected hundreds of staff in several units; some were reversed later in the day, but other reductions remain. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/trump-administration-lays-off-dozens-cdc-officials-nyt-reports-2025-10-11/))
  - IRS: IRS-wide furlough began Oct 8; about 53.6% of IRS employees were designated exempt and retained, with the rest furloughed. ([kpmg.com](https://kpmg.com/us/en/taxnewsflash/news/2025/10/irs-furlough-government-shutdown.html))

- Pay and funding measures:
  - Troops: On Oct 11, President Trump directed the Defense Department to use “all available funds” to ensure U.S. troops are paid on Oct 15, using roughly $8 billion in unobligated funds. This is a short-term workaround, not a fix to the funding stalemate.

  - This action does not restore pay for civilian federal employees, who remain largely unpaid during the lapse. ([washingtonpost.com](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/10/11/trump-military-pay-troops-government-shutdown/4460d6a6-a6cc-11f0-8f8b-d9483809ee65_story.html))

- Legislative status and path forward:
  - House action: On Sep 19, 2025, the House passed a clean Continuing Resolution (H.R. 5371) to keep the government funded through Nov 21, but the Senate had not taken up a similar measure as of Oct 12. ([appropriations.house.gov](https://appropriations.house.gov/news/press-releases/house-passes-hr-5371-continuing-appropriations-and-extensions-act-2026?utm_source=openai))
  - Senate/White House stance: Senate leadership has not approved a comparable stopgap; the White House has urged a resolution and signaled opposition to tying funding to unrelated policy asks. ([theguardian.com](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/11/republicans-democrats-us-government-shutdown))

- What to watch next:
  - A resolution likely hinges on negotiations over ACA subsidies and health-care subsidies, with each side pushing for terms before reopening the entire government. If no deal, the shutdown could persist for weeks. ([whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/09/democrats-put-veterans-seniors-public-safety-at-risk-with-shutdown-push/))

Bottom line: The government is still shut down as of Oct 12, 2025. A temporary pay fix for troops has been announced, but civilian pay remains stalled, and no final funding bill has cleared both chambers. Expect continued agency disruptions and further political negotiations in the days ahead.
