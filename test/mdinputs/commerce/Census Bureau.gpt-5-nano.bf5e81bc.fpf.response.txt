Updated status: U.S. government shutdown in effect (as of Oct 12, 2025)

- What happened: The FY2026 funding deadline passed on Oct 1, 2025, and Congress did not pass a funding bill. The result has been an ongoing shutdown. Reports describe hundreds of thousands of federal workers furloughed and some agencies implementing layoff notices.

- Latest developments (key actions since the shutdown began):
  - Military pay: On Oct 11, 2025, President Donald Trump directed the Defense Department to use “all available funds” to ensure U.S. troops are paid on Oct 15, a short-term patch that does not reopen the government. ([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/8601ea092fe746cc35b88076e70c4598))
  - Civilian payroll/downsizing: The White House budget office began layoffs, with Reuters reporting thousands of civilian federal workers already affected and more layoff notices issued. Overall, Reuters described roughly 4,200 workers affected in the new round of cuts, on top of hundreds of thousands previously subject to furloughs or downsizings.

  - Outreach on funding: The House passed H.R. 5371, the Continuing Appropriations and Extensions Act, 2026 (a short-term CR to keep the government open at current funding levels through a date in late November). The bill then faced opposition in the Senate. Congressional records show the bill as introduced and advanced in the House; Senate action remained uncertain as of mid-October.

- Where negotiations stand: The Senate has held cloture votes and debates on Democrat and Republican continuing-resolution proposals, but has not approved a final measure to reopen the full government. Status updates from the Senate Periodical Press Gallery show ongoing procedural battles over CRs (S. 2882 and H.R. 5371) with no final passage yet as of Oct 12.

- Economic/operational implications:
  - Furloughs and disruption: Contingency plans indicate hundreds of thousands of federal workers are furloughed, with ongoing uncertainty about pay, benefits, and which services remain fully operational. Independent briefings and coverage note the scale varies by agency and over time. The Congressional Budget Office has projected substantial daily costs and workforce furloughs in a shutdown scenario.

  - Core services: Entitlement programs (like Social Security, Medicare/Medicaid) generally continue, but many discretionary programs and regulatory activities are paused, with air travel and some regulatory processes affected in varying degrees.

- What to watch next (short-term):
  - Senate action on a CR or alternative funding package to reopen the government, likely around late October if negotiations progress.
  - Any new presidential or congressional moves to fund troops and back-pay while resolving broader budget talks.
  - Daily updates from major outlets (Reuters, AP, Washington Post) and official Congress.gov status pages for the latest on H.R. 5371 and related bills. ([congress.gov](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/5371/all-info?utm_source=openai))

Bottom line: A funding lapse remains in effect with no final resolution as of Oct 12, 2025. A narrow, temporary CR (H.R. 5371) has passed the House but awaits Senate action; military pay has been provisioned for a near-term date, while civilian employees face ongoing furloughs and layoffs. Expect continued stalemate until a bipartisan funding package is approved. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-government-workforce-cuts-have-begun-omb-chief-says-2025-10-10/))
