U.S. government shutdown — latest as of Sunday, October 12, 2025 (Day 12)

- Status: The federal government has been shut down since 12:01 a.m. ET on October 1 after Congress failed to pass a stopgap funding bill. The House-passed CR (H.R. 5371) has repeatedly failed to advance in the Senate; no deal was announced today.

- Why it happened: The core impasse is over health policy. Democrats insist any funding measure must extend enhanced Affordable Care Act premium tax credits (and address Medicaid cuts), while Republicans want a “clean” CR first. The House GOP bill would fund the government into November 21; a Senate Democratic alternative (S.2882) funds agencies into October 31 and includes the subsidy extension.

- New this weekend: President Trump directed the Pentagon to use unobligated funds so active-duty troops receive their October 15 paychecks despite the shutdown; it’s unclear how pay would be handled after that if the lapse continues, and the move does not cover civilian workers or the Coast Guard.

- Workforce fallout: The administration has begun layoffs across multiple agencies during the shutdown (including HHS, Treasury and parts of CDC), an atypical step that unions are challenging in court; a hearing on the legality of the layoffs is expected October 15.

- Back pay guidance shift: OMB revised its public shutdown FAQ to remove language affirming automatic back pay for furloughed workers once funding resumes, contradicting prior expectations and prompting criticism; OPM guidance still cites the 2019 law guaranteeing retroactive pay after a lapse.

- Scope of impact: Hundreds of thousands of federal employees are furloughed, with many agencies scaling back or pausing operations; essential services continue.

- What to watch next: Senate discussions about pairing a short-term CR with a time-limited ACA subsidy extension have percolated but haven’t yielded a breakthrough; Democrats are also seeking guardrails to pause firings and program clawbacks during any stopgap. Court action on layoffs (Oct 15) and whether military pay can be sustained beyond October 15 are near-term flash points.
