U.S. government shutdown — where things stand (as of Sunday, Oct 12, 2025)

Status
- The federal government has been shut since 12:01 a.m. ET on Oct 1 after Congress failed to pass FY2026 funding. Repeated Senate attempts to advance two rival stopgaps have failed: the House-passed H.R. 5371 (“clean” CR to Nov 21) and a Senate Democratic CR (S. 2882) that would also extend enhanced ACA premium tax credits.

- Core dispute: Democrats want any funding bill to include an extension of enhanced ACA premium subsidies that expire at year’s end; Republicans propose reopening the government first and debating health care separately.

- The shutdown has furloughed large numbers of federal workers and left others working without pay; IRS said it is furloughing roughly 34,000 employees (about 46% of staff).

What changed in the last 48–72 hours
- Troop pay: On Oct 11, President Trump directed DoD to use “all available funds” so active‑duty service members are paid on Oct 15, tapping unobligated Pentagon funds; it’s unclear whether pay can continue beyond that if the shutdown persists. ([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/8601ea092fe746cc35b88076e70c4598?utm_source=openai))
- Layoffs amid the shutdown: Agencies began issuing layoffs and RIF notices; CDC and other departments saw significant cuts, prompting union lawsuits and a court hearing set for Oct 15.

- WIC lifeline: USDA provided about $300 million (from prior‑year tariff revenue) to keep the Women, Infants and Children program running for now, after warnings it could run out of money within weeks.

- Smithsonian closures: Smithsonian museums and the National Zoo stayed open through Saturday, Oct 11, using prior‑year funds; they close to the public starting Sunday, Oct 12, if the shutdown continues. ([si.edu](https://www.si.edu/newsdesk/releases/smithsonian-update?utm_source=openai))

Impact snapshot
- Social Security/Medicare: Benefits continue; SSA offices are open with reduced services. ([ssa.gov](https://www.ssa.gov/agency/shutdown?utm_source=openai))
- Travel: FAA/TSA staff are working without pay; controller shortages have caused intermittent delays at several major airports as the agency slows traffic for safety.

- National parks: Many sites remain physically accessible with limited or no services; conditions vary by park and some rely on local funding to stay open. ([kpbs.org](https://www.kpbs.org/news/politics/2025/10/04/national-parks-caught-in-the-crosshairs-of-government-shutdown?utm_source=openai))
- Taxes/IRS: Significant furloughs are disrupting call centers and other operations. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/world/irs-furlough-34000-employees-due-us-government-shutdown-2025-10-08/?utm_source=openai))
- Public health: CDC layoffs and suspended NIH activities (e.g., most new grants, many meetings; limited Clinical Center admissions) are constraining health services and research. ([washingtonpost.com](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/10/11/cdc-layoffs-public-health-shutdown/?utm_source=openai))
- Economy: Private estimates suggest each week of shutdown trims Q4 GDP growth by roughly 0.1–0.2 percentage points; data releases from some agencies may be delayed. ([ey.com](https://www.ey.com/en_us/insights/strategy/macroeconomics/us-government-shutdown-hits-us-economy?utm_source=openai))

What’s next
- Key near‑term pressure points include the Oct 15 military payday (partly addressed by the DoD directive) and the Oct 15 court hearing on federal layoff challenges. ([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/8601ea092fe746cc35b88076e70c4598?utm_source=openai))
- The Senate has repeatedly failed to advance either CR; further action is expected when leaders reach a bipartisan deal. House leaders have kept the chamber out through at least Oct 13 to pressure the Senate. ([congress.gov](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/5371/all-info?utm_source=openai))

Bottom line: As of Oct 12, the shutdown continues with no agreement yet. Talks remain centered on whether to pair a short‑term funding bill with an extension of ACA premium tax credits.
