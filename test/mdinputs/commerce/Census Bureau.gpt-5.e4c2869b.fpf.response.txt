U.S. government shutdown — status as of Sunday, October 12, 2025 (Day 12)

- Where things stand
  - The federal government has been shut down since 12:01 a.m. ET on Wednesday, October 1, after Congress failed to pass FY2026 funding. Both sides remain dug in, with Democrats demanding action on expiring ACA premium subsidies and Republicans pushing their own stopgap plan.

- Capitol Hill outlook
  - The Senate has repeatedly failed to advance either party’s bill; senators left town and scheduled the next vote for Tuesday, October 14 at 5:30 p.m. ET. The House is not in session, and Speaker Mike Johnson has said he won’t bring members back for a standalone troop‑pay bill.

- New executive moves
  - President Trump directed the Pentagon to use “all available funds” to ensure active‑duty troops are paid on October 15, tapping unobligated Defense funds. It’s unclear how pay would be handled if the shutdown continues beyond this week. ([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/8601ea092fe746cc35b88076e70c4598?utm_source=openai))

- Federal workforce and agencies
  - The administration has begun layoffs across multiple departments (Treasury, HHS, Education, Commerce, DHS’s CISA), issuing more than 4,000 reduction‑in‑force notices, with a court hearing on their legality set for Wednesday, October 15.

  - At CDC, hundreds of layoff notices were sent and then partially rescinded within hours; broader cuts remain under consideration as the shutdown persists.

- Pay/back pay and services
  - IRS guidance that initially told furloughed workers to expect back pay was walked back; OMB will issue further instructions, leaving some uncertainty for furloughed civilians. Essential operations continue, but many services are reduced or paused.

- What to watch next (this week)
  - Tuesday, Oct. 14: Senate cloture vote (8th attempt) on the House‑passed “clean” short‑term funding bill.

  - Wednesday, Oct. 15: Military paycheck date (administration says pay will go out); federal court hearing on union challenge to shutdown‑era layoffs. ([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/8601ea092fe746cc35b88076e70c4598?utm_source=openai))

Bottom line: The shutdown is now in its second week with no agreement in hand. The key near‑term pressure points are Tuesday’s Senate vote and Wednesday’s military paychecks and court hearing; absent a breakthrough, agency disruptions and workforce impacts will deepen.
