One‑page update on the government shutdown (as of Sunday, Oct 12, 2025)

Status
- The federal government has been in a partial shutdown since 12:01 a.m. EDT on Oct 1. Today is day 12. ([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/8601ea092fe746cc35b88076e70c4598?utm_source=openai))

Where negotiations stand
- House passed a stopgap funding bill (H.R. 5371) on Sept 19 to keep the government open through Nov 21. The Senate rejected it on Sept 19 and again on Sept 30; a motion to reconsider is pending. ([appropriations.house.gov](https://appropriations.house.gov/news/press-releases/house-passes-hr-5371-continuing-appropriations-and-extensions-act-2026?utm_source=openai))
- The key dispute: Senate Democrats want any short‑term deal to include an extension of Affordable Care Act premium subsidies that expire Dec 31, 2025; Republicans insist on a “clean” CR and say health policy talks should occur after reopening. ([naco.org](https://www.naco.org/news/senate-lawmakers-release-continuing-resolution-fund-government-until-october-31))
- Next action: The Senate is scheduled to return Tuesday, Oct 14, with a 5:30 p.m. cloture vote to proceed to H.R. 5371. ([democrats.senate.gov](https://www.democrats.senate.gov/2025/10/09/schedule-for-pro-forma-session-and-tuesday-october-14-2025))

New developments in the last 48–72 hours
- Troop pay: President Trump directed the Pentagon to use “all available funds” so active‑duty service members receive paychecks on Oct 15, likely by tapping unobligated DoD funds. It is unclear whether pay can continue if the shutdown persists. (Coast Guard is not covered by this directive.) ([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/8601ea092fe746cc35b88076e70c4598?utm_source=openai))
- Federal workforce: The administration began layoffs at multiple agencies (Treasury, HHS—including CDC, Education, Commerce, and DHS’s cybersecurity arm). More than 4,200 employees have received layoff notices; a federal judge will hear a unions’ challenge on Wed, Oct 15.

- Back pay uncertainty: OMB quietly revised shutdown guidance, removing language that referenced the 2019 law guaranteeing retroactive pay for furloughed workers; OPM’s guidance still says back pay is due when funding is restored. GOP leaders say they expect workers to receive back pay, but the White House memo has created ambiguity.

Operational impacts (snapshot)
- Hundreds of thousands of federal employees are furloughed; others are working without pay. Agency disruptions are widespread, with notable effects at HHS/CDC and IRS among others. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-government-workforce-cuts-have-begun-omb-chief-says-2025-10-10/))

What to watch next
- Tue, Oct 14: Senate cloture vote to proceed to the House‑passed CR (H.R. 5371). A successful cloture vote would open the door to debating and amending the bill. ([democrats.senate.gov](https://www.democrats.senate.gov/2025/10/09/schedule-for-pro-forma-session-and-tuesday-october-14-2025))
- Wed, Oct 15: Court hearing on the legality of federal layoffs during the shutdown; also the first military payday affected (after the President’s directive). ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-government-workforce-cuts-have-begun-omb-chief-says-2025-10-10/))

Bottom line
- The shutdown continues with no deal yet. The near‑term resolution hinges on whether Senate leaders can agree Tuesday to proceed on the House CR and whether any accommodation on ACA subsidies emerges to secure the 60 votes needed in the Senate.
