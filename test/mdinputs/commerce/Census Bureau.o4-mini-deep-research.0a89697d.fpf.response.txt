# Government Shutdown Update

Key funding proposals are still unresolved as the October 1 deadline approaches.  For example, Reuters reports that the White House has proposed a continuing resolution to *“extend current federal funding through January 31”* of 2026 to push out the shutdown date ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/white-house-seeks-keep-funding-autopilot-through-january-31-avoid-shutdown-2025-09-09/#:~:text=To%20prevent%20a%20partial%20government,the%20fiscal%20year%2C%20to%20act)).  In contrast, House Republicans earlier backed a six-month stopgap (funding operations through Sept. 2025) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-house-republicans-unveil-six-month-stopgap-bill-avert-shutdown-2025-03-08/#:~:text=House%20Republicans%20have%20unveiled%20a,aims%20to%20allow%20Republicans%20to)) – a plan criticized by Democrats as a partisan *“power grab”* ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-house-republicans-unveil-six-month-stopgap-bill-avert-shutdown-2025-03-08/#:~:text=efficiency%20cuts%20proposed%20by%20Elon,criticizing%20it%20as%20a%20power)).  Both measures maintain current spending levels but require bipartisan approval (House Dems and the Senate) to pass.  As one report notes, *“Congress has until September 30, the end of the fiscal year, to act”* or face a partial shutdown on October 1 ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/white-house-seeks-keep-funding-autopilot-through-january-31-avoid-shutdown-2025-09-09/#:~:text=To%20prevent%20a%20partial%20government,the%20fiscal%20year%2C%20to%20act)).

With talks stalled, the political impasse is clear.  Axios (Sept. 30) quotes House Democrats as saying they are already *“preparing for [the shutdown’s] impact”* rather than expecting a deal, given deep mistrust of GOP leaders ([www.axios.com](https://www.axios.com/2025/09/30/government-shutdown-democrats-trump-white-house#:~:text=As%20a%20looming%20government%20shutdown,stalled%20talks%2C%20particularly%20regarding%20the)).  Demands over expiring healthcare subsidies and other priorities remain unresolved, and GOP leaders have refused to negotiate on those terms.  In short, many lawmakers expect that, unless a compromise is reached by midnight, the government will indeed partially shut down.

**Operations in a shutdown:**  Agencies are already outlining contingency plans.  Reuters reports that Health and Human Services would furlough about 41% of its employees (halting clinical trials) and other routine projects ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/world-at-work/trump-administrations-shutdown-plans-trickle-deadline-nears-2025-09-29/#:~:text=of%20Health%20and%20Human%20Services,including%20the%20monthly%20employment%20report)).  The Labor Department would suspend major data releases (including the monthly jobs report) in a shutdown ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/world-at-work/trump-administrations-shutdown-plans-trickle-deadline-nears-2025-09-29/#:~:text=of%20Health%20and%20Human%20Services,including%20the%20monthly%20employment%20report)).  By law, only essential services (national security, Social Security/Medicare payments, etc.) would continue. 

**Summary:**  As of the latest reports, Congress has not agreed on a funding bill, and both the White House and House GOP have put forward temporary measures (to January and September, respectively) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/white-house-seeks-keep-funding-autopilot-through-january-31-avoid-shutdown-2025-09-09/#:~:text=To%20prevent%20a%20partial%20government,the%20fiscal%20year%2C%20to%20act)) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-house-republicans-unveil-six-month-stopgap-bill-avert-shutdown-2025-03-08/#:~:text=House%20Republicans%20have%20unveiled%20a,aims%20to%20allow%20Republicans%20to)).  With the clock running out, lawmakers are bracing for a shutdown.  If no stopgap bill passes by Oct. 1, many federal workers will be furloughed and nonessential government services will largely halt ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/world-at-work/trump-administrations-shutdown-plans-trickle-deadline-nears-2025-09-29/#:~:text=of%20Health%20and%20Human%20Services,including%20the%20monthly%20employment%20report)) ([www.axios.com](https://www.axios.com/2025/09/30/government-shutdown-democrats-trump-white-house#:~:text=As%20a%20looming%20government%20shutdown,stalled%20talks%2C%20particularly%20regarding%20the)).
