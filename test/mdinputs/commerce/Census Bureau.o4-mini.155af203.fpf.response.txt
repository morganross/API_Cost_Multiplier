As of October 12, 2025, the federal government shutdown, which began at 12:01 a.m. EDT on October 1, has entered its 12th day with no resolution in sight:

- Congress remains deadlocked. On October 11, the Senate rejected motions to advance both Republican and Democratic stopgap funding bills for a seventh time and adjourned until Tuesday afternoon, October 14, when it will vote again on competing measures ([cbsnews.com](https://www.cbsnews.com/live-updates/government-shutdown-live-updates-as-military-poised-to-miss-first-paychecks-next-week/)).

- President Trump directed the Pentagon to tap roughly $8 billion in unobligated research and development funds to guarantee that active-duty service members receive their October 15 paychecks despite the shutdown, invoking his authority as Commander-in-Chief ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-says-his-administration-identified-funds-pay-troops-during-shutdown-2025-10-11/?utm_source=openai)).

- The administration has begun issuing reduction-in-force (RIF) notices to more than 4,200 federal employees at seven agencies—including Treasury; Health and Human Services; Commerce; Education; and Homeland Security’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency—and frozen $28 billion in infrastructure funding for New York, California, and Illinois to pressure Senate Democrats to negotiate ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-government-workforce-cuts-have-begun-omb-chief-says-2025-10-10/)). Labor unions have sued to block these layoffs, and a federal judge is set to hear the case on October 15 ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-government-workforce-cuts-have-begun-omb-chief-says-2025-10-10/)).

- At the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, approximately 1,300 employees were mistakenly issued layoff notices due to a “coding error”; hundreds of those notices were rescinded within hours, but critical units—such as the team producing the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report—remain disrupted, raising public-health concerns amid ongoing disease outbreaks ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-government-workforce-cuts-have-begun-omb-chief-says-2025-10-10/)).

- Essential air-traffic controllers continue working without pay, leading to flight delays at major U.S. airports; meanwhile, Democrats warn that with Affordable Care Act premium subsidies set to expire December 31 and open enrollment beginning November 1, millions could face sharply higher insurance costs unless a funding deal is reached ([cbsnews.com](https://www.cbsnews.com/live-updates/government-shutdown-live-updates-as-military-poised-to-miss-first-paychecks-next-week/)).

- Both parties remain entrenched: Republicans refuse to negotiate on healthcare policy until the government reopens, while Democrats insist on extending ACA subsidies as a condition for any stopgap funding. With neither side yielding, the shutdown is expected to extend into at least a third week when Congress reconvenes Tuesday ([abcnews.go.com](https://abcnews.go.com/Health/affordable-care-act-subsidies-sticking-point-government-shutdown/story?id=126322841)).
