## Introduction  
After failing to enact any of the twelve annual appropriations bills by September 30, Congress relied on two stopgap measures—extending funding through March 14 and then through September 30—to keep the government operating. When the Full-Year Continuing Appropriations and Extensions Act, 2025 lapsed at midnight on September 30, no subsequent spending bill secured the 60 votes needed in the Senate, triggering a full government shutdown at 12:01 a.m. EDT on October 1, 2025. This marks the 11th shutdown in modern U.S. history and the third under President Trump’s administration, resulting in roughly 900,000 federal employees being furloughed and another 700,000 working without pay while essential services operate at reduced capacity.

## Legislative Impasse  
Since the shutdown began, Senate efforts to advance short-term funding have repeatedly stalled. Cloture motions on the House-passed seven-week continuing resolution (H.R. 5371), which would fund operations through November 21, were rejected by votes of 55–45 on October 1, 54–44 on October 3 and 52–42 on October 6. Meanwhile, Democratic counterproposal S. 2882, extending funding to October 31 and permanently preserving ACA insurance subsidies, failed by votes of 47–53, 46–52 and 45–50 on the same dates. After seven failed cloture attempts, the Senate adjourned until Tuesday, October 14, when Majority Leader John Thune has scheduled another consideration of the GOP-backed measure.

## Political Positions  
Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) has kept the House on recess until the government reopens, maintaining the chamber fulfilled its duty by passing H.R. 5371 and insisting Senate Democrats now bear responsibility for ending the shutdown. In the Senate, Majority Leader Thune and other Republicans have refused to eliminate the 60-vote filibuster threshold, accusing Democrats of holding the military “hostage” over enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidy demands. Senate Democrats, in turn, have leveraged their 41 votes to insist on extending premium tax credits set to expire in December 2025 before supporting any funding measure. This standoff underscores how both parties are using the shutdown as leverage for broader policy priorities on health care, domestic spending and foreign aid rescissions.

## Executive Actions  
On October 11, President Trump directed Secretary of War Pete Hegseth to tap approximately $8 billion in unobligated research, development, testing and evaluation funds to ensure active-duty troops receive their October 15 paychecks despite the shutdown. This order, issued via Truth Social, invokes his authority as Commander in Chief but applies only to military personnel; no comparable measures have been announced to safeguard civilian federal workers, who remain furloughed without pay.

## Impacts  
Operational disruptions have been widespread. According to a Justice Department court filing, over 4,200 federal employees at seven agencies have received reduction-in-force notices—including roughly 1,446 at the Department of Treasury and 1,100 at Health and Human Services—and dozens of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention staff, including the agency’s Washington office, were targeted. Air traffic controllers, deemed essential, have worked unpaid, leading to flight delays at multiple major airports. The shutdown has also halted the collection and dissemination of key economic data by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Bureau of Economic Analysis and Census Bureau, delaying reports critical to policymakers and investors.

## Outlook  
The standoff shows little sign of swift resolution. Senate Republicans must secure at least five additional votes to overcome the filibuster on H.R. 5371 when the chamber reconvenes on October 14 for a cloture vote at 5:30 p.m. Eastern. Meanwhile, Maryland Governor Wes Moore has launched state contingency plans to maintain essential federal services, urging an end to the shutdown, and Federal Reserve President Austan Goolsbee warns that missing economic reports could hamper monetary policy decisions. Union leaders have filed emergency lawsuits to block mass layoffs, with a court hearing set for October 16. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that roughly 750,000 employees could be furloughed each day at a cost of about $400 million in daily compensation, and private analysts project each week of shutdown trims GDP growth by approximately 0.1 percentage point. With these pressures mounting, next week’s Senate vote and pending legal rulings will likely determine whether the shutdown drags into a third week or yields to a bipartisan funding agreement.
