## Overview  
On October 1, 2025, at 12:01 a.m. EDT, the U.S. federal government entered a shutdown after Congress failed to enact appropriations for the 2026 fiscal year. The lapse resulted from deep partisan divides over overall spending levels, proposed rescissions of $7.9 billion in foreign aid and $1.1 billion for public broadcasting under the Rescissions Act of 2025, and disputes over expanded health insurance subsidies under the Affordable Care Act. As of October 12, the shutdown has stretched into its 12th day—marking the 11th curtailment of services in modern U.S. history—and has furloughed roughly 900,000 federal employees while leaving another 700,000 working without pay. Essential functions such as Medicare, Medicaid and Transportation Security Administration operations continue under contingency plans.

## Legislative Impasse  
Efforts to bridge the funding gap have repeatedly stalled on Capitol Hill. On October 8, a Democratic-sponsored continuing resolution aimed at funding government operations and extending ACA subsidies failed to reach the 60 votes needed to overcome a Senate filibuster, underscoring the entrenched partisan standoff. Republicans, controlling both the House and Senate, have steadfastly refused to include expanded healthcare subsidies in any short-term bill, while Democrats have declined to support measures that omit these protections. House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries even recalled lawmakers for additional talks, but those sessions yielded no breakthrough, leaving neither side willing to budge.

## Impact on Federal Workforce and Services  
The shutdown’s human and operational toll has been immediate and widespread. Approximately 900,000 workers remain furloughed, and 700,000 continue to perform “essential” duties without compensation, straining both morale and household budgets. Public health agencies, including the CDC and NIH, have suspended critical research and disease-surveillance functions. Transportation networks have also buckled: major hubs such as Chicago O’Hare and Newark reported flight delays of up to three hours amid shortages of 3,800 air traffic controllers. National Air Traffic Controllers Association President Nick Daniels warned that any further attrition could compromise safety margins, prompting the FAA to impose flow controls that magnified the backlog.

## Administration Actions: Layoffs and RIFs  
Seizing on the funding lapse, the Trump administration has initiated formal “reduction in force” (RIF) procedures. On October 10, OMB director Russell Vought informed a federal judge that seven Cabinet-level agencies — Commerce, Education, Energy, Health and Human Services, Housing and Urban Development, Homeland Security, and Treasury — had issued RIF notices to more than 4,100 employees. The Environmental Protection Agency also signaled potential layoffs for 20–30 staff, and other agencies reportedly review additional cuts. Employees receive 30 to 60 days’ notice per federal regulations. Federal unions have filed suit, arguing these RIFs likely violate the Antideficiency Act, and a court has ordered detailed RIF plans to be submitted ahead of an October 15 hearing.

## Agency Spotlight: CDC Mass Layoffs and Reversals  
The CDC, which plays a central role in outbreak response, saw the sharpest example of RIF volatility. In the second week of the shutdown, roughly 1,300 staff were notified of layoffs across multiple units, including those responsible for the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report and respiratory disease surveillance. Within hours, however, approximately 90 notices affecting 700 personnel were rescinded after internal review determined those roles essential for basic public health functions. HHS Communications Director Andrew Nixon defended the authority to close “duplicative entities,” while CDC employees warn that such abrupt cuts endanger preparedness and response capabilities.

## Military Personnel and Alternative Funding  
Facing the prospect of unpaid servicemembers, President Trump on October 11 directed the Department of Defense to repurpose about $8 billion in unobligated R&D funds from the prior fiscal year to cover October 15 military paychecks. This stopgap builds on precedents set in prior shutdowns but raises questions about longer-term funding if the lapse persists. Meanwhile, OMB general counsel has circulated a memo asserting that civilian furloughed workers are not automatically entitled to back pay absent explicit congressional appropriation, a position that has intensified legal and political tensions.

## Outlook and Next Steps  
With policymakers deadlocked, there is no immediate end in sight. House Speaker Mike Johnson has ruled out additional floor sessions until the shutdown concludes, while Senate leaders have yet to revise their positions. The upcoming October 15 court hearing on union challenges to RIF notices could heighten pressure on the administration. State governors and business groups have called for a swift resolution to avert broader economic disruption, warning that the longer the shutdown endures, the greater the risk to public confidence and financial markets. Absent a bipartisan breakthrough, both federal operations and national credence in governance will remain under strain.
