Background and Scope:  
Since the start of the 2025 fiscal year on October 1, 2024, the federal government operated under two continuing resolutions—initially through March 14, then through September 30 under the Full-Year Continuing Appropriations and Extensions Act—pending enactment of 12 regular funding bills. When those measures expired at midnight EDT on September 30, Congress failed to approve new appropriations, triggering a partial shutdown at 12:01 a.m. EDT on October 1, 2025. This marks the 11th federal shutdown in modern U.S. history, driven by partisan disputes over overall spending levels, proposed rescissions of foreign aid, and the status of Affordable Care Act subsidies. Furloughs have affected approximately 900,000 federal employees, while another 700,000 remain on duty without pay([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/October_2025_United_States_federal_government_shutdown?utm_source=openai)).

Impact on the Federal Workforce:  
Beyond widespread furloughs, the Office of Management and Budget has escalated cuts into formal RIF (Reduction-in-Force) notices affecting over 300,000 positions across Treasury, Health and Human Services, IRS, Education, Commerce, and DHS’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency. Layoff notices provide employees 30–60 days before separation, a process defended by OMB under impoundment authority. Concurrently, the CDC announced elimination of dozens of critical “disease detective” roles. Federal employee unions, including AFGE and NTEU, have filed suit seeking to block these layoffs; a hearing is scheduled for October 15 in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-government-workforce-cuts-have-begun-omb-chief-says-2025-10-10/?utm_source=openai)).

Agency Operations and Public Services:  
The shutdown has impeded a broad spectrum of federal activities. At the IRS, over 34,000 employees (46% of its workforce) are furloughed, crippling call centers and routine tax processing. The Labor Department’s Bureau of Labor Statistics and the Commerce Department’s Census Bureau and Bureau of Economic Analysis have suspended the release of September’s jobs report, Consumer Price Index, and GDP estimates. At the FAA, training programs for up to 17,000 air traffic controllers have been halted and minimum flight requirements reduced to avoid congestion at major hubs. Contingency plans across agencies—from HUD and EPA to NIH and the WIC nutrition program—have closed museums, delayed environmental inspections, and scaled back food assistance services([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/world/irs-furlough-34000-employees-due-us-government-shutdown-2025-10-08/?utm_source=openai)).

Administration Directives and Military Pay:  
On October 11, President Trump directed the Pentagon to redirect roughly $8 billion in unobligated research and development funds to guarantee October 15 paychecks for the 1.3 million active-duty personnel, invoking his authority as Commander in Chief. This extraordinary measure aims to shield troops from financial hardship despite the lapse in appropriations. No comparable commitment has been made for civilian federal employees—more than 900,000 remain furloughed without pay—nor has action been taken to extend back pay protections beyond mid-month, raising concerns for other essential national security personnel such as the Coast Guard([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-says-his-administration-identified-funds-pay-troops-during-shutdown-2025-10-11/?utm_source=openai)).

Legislative Stalemate:  
Early in the shutdown, the House passed H.R. 5371, a “clean” continuing resolution funding the government through November 21 with no policy riders, by a 217–212 vote. Senate Democrats filibustered the measure on September 22, falling short of the 60-vote threshold, and also blocked a rival Democrat-sponsored CR. Both chambers have since adjourned: the Senate will reconvene at 3 p.m. EDT on Tuesday, October 14, while Speaker Mike Johnson has kept the House in recess pending Senate action. Democrats insist any CR must renew and expand ACA health-care subsidies; Republicans demand spending cuts and foreign-aid rescissions. The impasse leaves no clear path to reopening([ncpa.org](https://ncpa.org/newsroom/qam/2025/09/22/shutdown-standoff-continues?utm_source=openai)).

Outlook:  
As the shutdown enters its second week, its economic and legal effects are deepening. Industries reliant on federal operations—particularly aviation and tourism—face acute losses; the U.S. Travel Association estimates daily impacts exceeding $140 million. Economists warn each week of closure could trim 0.15 percentage points off fourth-quarter GDP growth. Unions’ court challenge continues, with a hearing on October 15 to determine the legality of ongoing RIF notices. Critical research at NIH and disease-surveillance work at the CDC have been partially suspended, threatening clinical trials and public-health monitoring. With congressional leaders entrenched over ACA subsidies and budget rescissions, prospects for a swift resolution remain dim, underscoring the urgent need for bipartisan compromise to mitigate further disruptions([jp.reuters.com](https://jp.reuters.com/article/usa-shutdown-travel-idINL1N3B33BR/?utm_source=openai)).
