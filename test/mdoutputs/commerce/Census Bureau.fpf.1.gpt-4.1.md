# Report on Changes to the Census Bureau Over Time

## Introduction

The United States Census Bureau is a principal agency of the U.S. Federal Statistical System, responsible for collecting and producing data about the American people and economy. Established in 1902, its main role is to conduct the decennial census, which determines congressional representation, federal funding allocation, and provides critical demographic and economic data.

## Early History (Pre-1902)

- **1790:** The first U.S. census was conducted under the direction of Thomas Jefferson, then Secretary of State.
- **19th Century:** Census operations were managed as a temporary function within the Department of State, and later, the Department of the Interior.

## Establishment and Early Evolution (1902–1940s)

- **1902:** The Census Office became a permanent agency, renamed the Census Bureau, and placed under the newly created Department of Commerce and Labor.
- **Technological innovations:** Introduction of mechanical tabulating machines (Hollerith machines) in 1890 and continued use into the early 20th century improved data processing.

## Mid-20th Century Changes (1950s–1970s)

- **Post-WWII Modernization:** The Bureau adopted electronic computers (e.g., UNIVAC I in 1951) for data tabulation.
- **Expanded Surveys:** The Bureau began conducting a wide array of ongoing surveys, including the Current Population Survey and the American Housing Survey.
- **Civil Rights Era:** The Census Bureau adapted its methods to better capture information on race, ethnicity, and changing social dynamics.

## Late 20th Century to Early 21st Century

- **Technological Advances:** Increased use of digital data collection, geographic information systems (GIS), and the Internet.
- **American Community Survey (ACS):** Launched in 2005 to replace the long-form decennial census, providing rolling annual demographic data.
- **Organizational Shifts:** Enhanced focus on data confidentiality and security in response to public concerns.

## Recent Developments (2010s–Present)

- **2020 Census:** Marked the first time respondents could complete the census online.
- **Data Privacy:** Implementation of differential privacy techniques to protect individuals' identities in published data.
- **COVID-19 Impact:** The 2020 census faced operational challenges due to the pandemic, leading to adjustments in data collection methods and timelines.
- **Legislative and Political Changes:** Ongoing debates over census questions (e.g., citizenship) and funding.

## Conclusion

Over its history, the Census Bureau has evolved from a temporary, paper-based operation to a technologically advanced, permanent federal agency. Its mission and methods have adapted to new societal needs, technological opportunities, and legislative mandates, ensuring that it remains a cornerstone of American governance and planning.
